Q&A 10/3/2011


A: [recording starts in mid-sentence] ... dead cells like pineapple so you just take a thin slice of pineapple and just go like this all over your body...

Q: ... the formula, aren't you supposed to take the formula before the bath?

A: That is internal.
If you want to get rid of dead cells quicker, in your skin, then you just rub on pineapple but only do it once every 5 days. Because if you've got enough fat in your skin, in the cells in your skin, it won't dissolve your healthy skin. If you use this every day, every other day or every third day, it is going to get into the live cells and de-fat them and damage them. Pineapple is very...

Q: Can you just take a cube like that?

A: ... take a thin slice the size of your hand and go like this all over. That is for everywhere where you want to ...

Q: Is it internal too?

A: Well, yeah, that is for inside.

Q: … take it before you get in the hot water.

A: Internally, you can have pineapple every other day but on the surfaces, skin, you have it every 5 days.

Q: [inaudible] pineapple in the green juice. Do you not want me to do that much any more?

A: Sometimes. It depends on the person. ... for lymphatic or digestion...

Q: [inaudible] once a week[inaudible]

A: ... half butter and half... ... normally use half butter and half bone marrow. Sometimes I will put a tablespoon of coconut cream in it and about a tablespoon of the pineapple juice.

Q: What protects the skin from...

A: It protects it and also gives me enough pineapple to start breaking down dead cells.

Q: It protects it from what? ... protects the skin...

A: The cells need nourishment all the time. You've got poisons coming out through your skin because skin cells are going to be throwing off fat all the time. If they loose the fat, the poisons as they come out are going to damage the skin and kill it. That is when you start having a lot of sagging skin. It is dead skin. Dead cells can't absorb fat so when you put the butter and the bone marrow on there, it feeds the healthy cells so that when you put the pineapple on, it doesn't damage the healthy cells. It will only start dissolving the bromelain in it and other enzymes but won't dissolve the dead cells.

Q: When are you supposed to do this? After a hot bath?

A: ... a good time... If I do a hot bath and my massage therapist comes, I am out of a hot bath right when he gets there I get right on the massage table.

Q: When you get your bath and you put the bone marrow and butter on, [inaudible] and all the dead skin is coming out...

A: No, I got the dead skin off in the bath.

Q: So, you are protecting your skin ...

A: Cleaning the skin...

Q: Cleaning the skin but ... the toxins are coming into the bone marrow and butter?

A: The bone marrow and butter provide the fat the cells to protect themselves so that any toxins coming through my skin will not damage those cells. The fats are already strong so when it comes out the skin in perspiration or as dead skin cells, they won't damage those healthy cells, those live cells.

Q: Do you do a bath every day?

A: I only take a bath once a week.

Q: What do you do right after you take the bath? Is that the best time?

A: Right after the bath, I have the massage.

Q: Right after you come out?

A: Yep.

Q: What do you mean massage?

A: I have a massage therapist come...

Q: And then you use that soap mixture? What if you don't have the massage therapist - do you just put it on anyway?

A: I like to rub it onto my skin.

Q: That sagging, that is dead cells...

A: Most of it is dead cells.

Q: So, how do you avoid that?

A: That is just what I was telling you - how to avoid it and also how to get rid of it. [group noise, happy birthday to someone who just arrived]]

Q: [person asks what she missed]

A: Take a thin slice of pineapple and just rub it all over, everywhere. I had a patient who had descending testicles. He got a flu shot and poisons went to his testicles and his testicles fell like 4 inches within 6 months and I had him rub pineapple juice on it every five days and within about two months it was right back. This is a man in his sixties.

Q: After the pineapple, do you put the butter with the bone marrow? Do you just leave the pineapple on?

A: ... but you just do it every five days.

Q: Do you wash it off?

A: No. If you put so much on that it causes your skin to sting, then I would wipe it off. I would blot it off.

Q: Is this also on your face?

A: Everywhere, yeah.

Q: ... once a week...

A: Or less, every 5 - to 7 days.

Q: [inaudible question and answer] How long would it take for the sagging skin to be round?

A: Eventually. It takes time.

Q: Dead skin is created from what?

A: Either you are not eating enough meat to reproduce cells so your body holds onto dead cells or you are not eating enough fat to resolve dead cells or your lymph system is not working. There can be a dozen reasons why your body collects dead cells. But the skin has more than anywhere else usually. because most of the time they are leaving through the skin as damaged skin cells. If you do your massage or if you keep your body... ... if you do a bath then you should always put something on your skin - raw butter, bone marrow or that mixture,

Q: ... after the bath.

A: After the bath to protect your skin.

Q: What is in the bone marrow? What are the proportions?

A: 50/50.

Q: [different voice] I have very oily skin. I take baths frequently to knock the oil [inaudible].

A: Well, you are lucky. Most people don't have that kind of oil that lubricates the skin and protects it.

Q: I put coconut cream in the bathwater. Does that help?

A: I do that too.

Q: Do you still [inaudible]

A: Well, that I put on after the bath. I put milk, coconut cream, epsom salt in there [the bath water].

Q: If I get a whole house water filter system, will I still have to put those same things in it [the bath water]?

A: Just not as much. Very little after that. If you got a good 3 tier system, you know, where the canisters are this big and this tall...

Q: It is about this tall. a cup of milk,

A: Yeah, that is better. Lets say you have a paper one and you have coconut... a carbon and then a sand filter then you would only put maybe a half a cup of milk instead of a cup and a half. Oh, and you guys get your fluoride in your water on the 22nd.

Q: We do?

A: Yeah, 22nd of December. You start getting fluoride in your water.

Q: [inaudible]

A: No, that is what they are after.

Q: [new voice] You know there are some cities now that are starting to ban that.

A: Yeah.

Q: A couple of them ... having problems with money.. poison our citizens.

A: Absolutely.

Q: ... tax dollars... [inaudible]

A: Exactly. San Diego is the only major city that fought it off this long. On December 22nd, it is going in your water.

Q: Where is that coming from again, the fluoride?

A: Well, it comes from making aluminum and a lot of industrial military equipment.

Q: It is just a waste that they have got to go to a toxic waste dump.

A: It is a waste. It costs them millions and millions to handle it that way.. So just put it in the water.

Q: Put it in the water and say it is good for our teeth and bones. Oh my God. How misleading!

A: Well the worst thing about that is, they did that test, the results were that people had less cavities that had the fluoride in the water but they didn't count that they had less teeth. People that got the fluoride lost like 10% of their teeth. Their teeth were falling out. So they have fewer teeth to have cavities.

Q: Oh, I see. The ones that didn't have teeth had no cavities.

A: That is right.

Q: If you have no teeth, how could you have cavities!

A: Exactly.

Q: [new voice] I went to one of the city council meetings when they were discussing this fluoride and there was this ex-assembly man I think or council member whose name was Ron Roberts. He got up in front of them. He was talking about how important this was for the children. It made me feel like vomiting. I would have liked to go on up there and [inaudible].

A: Very few people know... The only reason I know about it is that when my nutritionist was teaching me, that information and the actual records were available so I got to see them. And I saw, you know, they had 10% less teeth, they lost - the people who got the fluoride lost - 10 percent more teeth than the people who didn't get the fluoride. And the rate of cavities would have been less in the group that didn't get fluoride , had they had their teeth. And the only reason they had less cavities was that they had less teeth. You can't get a hold of those tests any more. They have gotten rid of everything, all the evidence.

Q: Yeah. I'll tell you they are making it tricky.

A: So how did you hear about this?

Q: I went to [inaudible]

A: Oh, yes,

Q: ... in Mexico

A: And you met someone there.

Q: Yes [inaudible dialogue with Aajonus]

A: We just had a change on Monday

Q: [inaudible] We all started that way. To understand health, it is a journey. But it is a good thing. [continues inaudible monologue]

A: Well, if you want to know about health, don't go to any doctor, medical doctor. They know nothing about health. They only know disease and drugs. They are run by the pharmaceutical industry. And their intent is to have profits made by you taking drugs. So there are no cures. They don't offer any cures. They only offer a lifetime of medication.

Q: [inaudible]

A: Vitamin C is not real vitamin C. It is ascorbic acid. ... a chemical .And it doesn't have any of the appearance of true vitamin C. The only way you can get vitamin C is from food.

Q: ... I had to take so much, all concentrate

A: That is all quantity. When you eat a raw diet, you don't need a lot. When you eat a cooked diet, you have a lot of toxins and you need your proportion of vitamin C magnifies by almost 10 times.

Q: ... When you are on a clean diet, you need little once your body starts... You get results within a day. I've been doing this, not completely, because I have been doing it slowly for what, 5 or 6 years. But you need very little. And then you start looking at all this junk that you buy and all this money that you are wasting and how much you have to take every morning - a whole bowl full in your hand to take them with water...

A: It is chemical, it is not food.

Q:... and you don't even understand it. You think "well, that is the way I grew up. It is the way the doctors tell me. That is what the TV tells me." And it is all one big lie. And it is hard to turn your mind around and say "How do I change all that? If I go out, there is nowhere to go to eat healthy. I have to go to a fast food place. You have to start making all your food and you have to carry it with you. It is a whole different mind reality. But if you want health and if you want happiness and you want to be [inaudible], it is a discipline, it is a discipline. You can't say I want just a pill to fix it. Everything about your life you have to say I want peace and I want happiness. You have to decide how to do it because your health, when you start losing your energy and when you start losing your body, you eventually say I've got to do something. And then every day it is your choice how you want to go about it. The doctors want to kill you. And they just want your money. Your self discipline and the knowledge that you are going to get... In this case, this man - he's got knowledge.

Q: [different voice, inaudible]

A: I've worked with 5 patients with Hashimoto’s [disease] and all of them were reversed.

Q: [inaudible]

A: I've told them not to take any. ... to eat food.

Q: [inaudible]

A: No, the more you do, you keep doing damage every time you take it.

Q: [different voice - what has she got?

A: Hashimoto’s [disease] - it is a [interrupted]

Q: Thyroid...

A: When it is a Hashimoto’s [disease], it is combined with the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system doesn't work along with the thyroid. But I tell everybody... it is absolute malarkey that your problem is your thyroid because the thyroid handles the heart and the lungs. It doesn't handle energy, it doesn't handle air loss or anything like that; it doesn't affect that. That is medical malarkey. It is not true. But they make millions and millions and millions of dollars selling thyroid medications because they say that it has to do with this. And it doesn't. You've got inability to utilize fats properly. You just need to eat a diet that will help you utilize fats. And you have to eat proper fats. But get my books and that will get you started.

Q: And with the book do I get started? Or do I have to have a designed diet for my...

A: Well, if you want to get through it faster, I can help you get through it but I don't take anybody on unless they have read at least my first book first.

Q: Yeah, I will. I think I can buy it here. Can I buy the books here?

A: No, sold it out yesterday. I have the recipe book but I don't have We Want To Live.[the host of the Q&A] might have one.

Q: [inaudible monologue by woman with Hashimoto’s disease]

A: ... brainwashed.... The pharmaceutical industry runs the medical industry. They write all the manuals for the doctors to follow. They give incredible amounts of money to all of the medical universities, fund them and keep them in good stature. Everybody listens to the doctors.

Q: I am not sure if that is corrupt... [inaudible]

A: The medical doctors are all trained all around the world the same. ... by the same manuals from the pharmaceutical industry. Once you are trained that way, that's it; that is all you know. They don't want them to know anything else. Let's start going around. Do you have a question?

Q: I do. [inaudible] all tied together. Sometimes my knees pop out of their joints back there. Sometimes I hear a popping or cracking sound in my joints. And my left ankle, which I have broken and/or sprained 3 different times with them feeling weaker...

A: How many years?

Q: How many years ago did I do it?

A: How many years? You say you broke it 3 times?

Q: I broke it once when I was about 16. And then after that I can't remember if it sprained twice or broke it once again. That was probably within the next, say, 10 years.

A: So, about 16 and about 26?

Q: I don't remember exactly.

A: Well, that is pretty good.

Q: And my knees, this morning I was in bed and just turned [inaudible]. Sometimes I can go for years. Then all of a sudden lately it happened.

A: When it is cold like this, your body will detox joints and bones easier. ...when it is cold. So a lot of people will have a lot of joint and bone problems in the winter because of the cleansing of that. And if you are popping it, that means you are not getting enough fats in that joint to handle the toxicity that is being released either from the bone marrow discharging through the joint or just getting rid of some toxicity in the cartilage.

Q: How do I get the fat to that area?

A: ... lubrication formula, moisturizing formula

Q: [inaudible] don't do that.

A: OK. That is all you can do. Take your hot baths and if you have a thicker joint that is more affected then you put a hot water bottle near that one at night. That will force more circulation and more nutrients to that area, and more fats with it.

Q: OK. And the fact that I still have some arthritis and still have swelling here and swelling on the sides of my knees and stuff, is that...

A: Swelling is a good thing. Swelling means there are more nutrients going into that area to cleanse it and heal it. You can just put a hot water bottle on any joint where you are having a problem. Any time you have pain anywhere, you want to increase nutrients to that area and you can do that with heat. That will increase... it will cause everything to relax and swell and will get more nutrients into it.

Q: How fast with the hot water bottles?

A: If you go into a bath the whole body is going to be heated. It is not going to focus on that one problem area. At night, while you are asleep, put a hot water bottle near that problem area so the body will focus on that area.

Q: .. even if there isn't any pain. I am not feeling any pain. I just see the swelling.

A: If you have cracking that means you are not getting enough fat in it. So put the water bottle there. Even if there is no pain. It is a sign that there is dryness, not enough fat and that is cracking.

Q: You did say dryness is from, sulfur?

A: Sulfur can cause dryness.

Q: What else causes dryness?

A: ... toxins that are in the body ... the body using up the fats to bind with toxins. There are a lot of things that can cause dryness. ... many toxins. Even hydrogenated fat causes dryness because it is plastic. It is not a fat that your body can utilize properly to lubricate itself so it will cause dryness. Do you have a question?

Q: I have a degenerated disk in the back. hot water bottle... [inaudible]

A: Absolutely. But if you have a degenerated disk ... that you can actually see it dissolving? What does it look like?

Q: ... there is not enough space...

A: So the hot water bottle is the main thing you have to do because you have to expand those tendons. Right now they are choking everything and will keep compressing. And your body will start dissolving its vertebrae to make up for that and they will start shrinking. So, if you put the heat there, it will allow the tendons that hold the spine, the spinal chord, together, the column together - to allow them to relax and there will be space. That is the only way you can do it. Also, yoga. You can do the spinal twist, whether sitting spinal twist or lying down spinal twist to make sure that after you use the heat, ... you use the hot water bottle at night, get up in the morning then do the spinal twist to make sure that everything is stretched, while it is still soft, while it is still relaxed. Then it will stretch it even more. By the time it is night time again, you would again stretch before you go to sleep and put the hot water bottle on there.

Q: [inaudible] pain.

A: Always do heat first. ... still hanging in the warmth.

Q: [different voice] The spinal twist is a really important thing to do.

A: Yeah. If you are doing stretching when the tendons are all relaxed and soft, it will make them more tense. So as soon as you get off that you go right back to [inaudible]. Sometimes it will turn off like that and press on the nerve and cause pain. You have got to put heat first because tendons, when you stretch them, they will stay stretched and not go right back like a rubber band.

Q: [inaudible] my physical therapist who will have me go on heat then I stretch.

A: Good. Is he using a heating pad? ... electric heating pad or water?

Q: A hydrometer[inaudible] water [inaudible]

A: He ... put it in a microwave oven with nuclear...

Q: Oh yeah, with radioactive material... not a good thing... heat pads

A: That is OK.

Q: [different voice] ...[inaudible] would be sinful and very effective.

Q: I think I know what you are talking about.

Q: OK let me show you. [silence] I am not too good these days with my arms with uncomfortable stuff I have been going through. I haven't been doing this for a long time but I can show you. I will do the lying down one then I will do the sitting up one. [demonstrates yoga positions].
I prefer the lying one because...

A: ... more relaxed

Q: Lying down is easier. [describes what she is doing to get into the position] ... is relaxing...

A: Sometimes it may not be relaxing for the first minute. But the longer you are in it, the more you relax unless you go into it too fast. If you lie down then don't do it slowly like she did, just go right in and immediately turn it over, you can cause yourself to go into a cramp. ... a charley horse in your back.

Q: The key thing is you really have to follow your [body? inaudible] That is the one thing I can't monitor is my body not being healthy at the moment. I am leaning really slightly to the left. I am going to align my head and chin [describes getting into the posture]

A: You can also use your hand like she is going to do to push it down.

Q: [describes her actions in the posture]

A: ... and if you hold that position for 40 minutes on each side, that will be enough.

Q: [discussion between person with disk trouble and the lady demonstrating the yoga position] You have to work with him [meaning Aajonus].

A: Let me tell you, when I had all my back problems from the radiation therapy, there was nothing that relieved me more than that. I also I also had to go into the plow [yoga position] too.

Q: [inaudible].. take it slowly.

A: Those took care of my upper vertebrae.

Q: [lady describes and demonstrates pressure points] You need to understand that it is a 'what do I do now, what do I do right now?' Everything has... You might need physical movement; you might need internal relief with meridians. You don't know. [inaudible]. You don't know that your guidance is accurate.

A: Now why wouldn't your physical therapist like that exercise?

Q: Well, [inaudible monologue]

A: You've got cramped vertebrae, that is the only thing that is going to reveal it and release it properly. I mean, you could hang upside down but that is still not going to make it stretch enough like it will in that position.

Q: You have to understand your fear might be buying into... your [inaudible] might be buying into what you need to do. Like the influence of somebody else telling you what to do.

A: Do it for a week and see! The thing is you don't go into it fast.

Q: What about [another yoga position]?

A: ... the foetal position...

Q: [further description of yoga]

A: It stretches the tendons out so there is no pressure. But that is all you can do with those spinal twists.

Q: I don't know if I can do exercises myself.

A: That one is easy if you are lying down. If you do the sitting one, that is very strenuous.

Q: [inaudible] ... problem with my back...

Q: [inaudible] makes the large intestines heal.[monologue about various practices] When you do this diet, we look at all this psychological stuff. Everything is moving all the time. [further monologue about psychological factors].

A: I don't have those same opinions like I said in my book but fear can keep you from doing what you need to do. Like - ‘I should have been eating raw meat’ for three years when it was first introduced to me but I had such a fear for that three years, I had to go to the point of wanting to kill myself thinking that the raw meat would do it and then discovering it was exactly what I needed. It was three years of stupid fear. And the doctors put it in my head.

Q: [inaudible]

A: I would say just do that posture. Probably you are talking about... All you need to do is that posture.

Q: [further monologue by the lady]

A: When I had that radiation therapy that cauterized my spine, I was in pain all day long, 24 hours a day. I was able to sleep only 10 minutes at a time without waking up with excruciating pain. The first freedom from that was when I learned to go into a hot bath ...to sleep in a hot bath
[inaudible] my body became buoyant and had less pressure on my back. So I could sleep there as long as I could until the water got too cold, then I would wake up freezing cold. Then I would let some water out and re-heat it. Then, I couldn't live in the bath tub any more; I did that for a year, practically lived in the bathtub 14 - 16 hours a day. Then I had to find another way, and I did everything. When I learned those two positions right there, on either side, it changed my life. I was able to start bicycling then. That is when I went out at 27 years old and was able to start bicycling. I still had to get off the bicycle every hour to hour and a half and go into those two positions and the plow and I did that for maybe 10 minutes. - 3 minutes per position - a minute in between. ... those 3 positions, 9 minutes, a minute in between... the plow and the spinal twists. I was able to get on that bike for another hour or hour and a half and ride again. Those two positions right there gave me more ease from my back than any other. Just try it.

Q: [new voice] To piggy back on that, do you have an opinion about a difference between yoga and Pilates?

A: Well, I studied yoga and I taught yoga. Pilates, I have only looked at a video but have never done it so I really can't talk about it.

Q: Pilates is a practice of elongating the body. It is a little bit different than yoga. It stresses the core muscles . When you are doing Pilates, you are coming up this way. You are trying to tighten the core muscles. [inaudible] stretches. So then you find ways to stretch. Yoga also does that but in a different way.

Q: [other voice] So it is really two different modalities...

A: Yoga is about relaxing and stretching. Pilates is about firming and toning.

Q: You are trying to elongate which means to stretch but it is done from a core position. [continues monologue].

A: Yoga is basically - when I studied it, when I taught - to stretch everything. Like animals, when they first get up, you see them all stretch and move around so they can be limber so they can be fast. If you've got joints rubbing on each other, you are going to wear down your cartilage. Yoga is about stretching everything out to be limber. Then of course we've got Bikram yoga in there to get you to sweat and exercise - quick stuff. But yoga was always a slow meditative process to stretch the body in all different positions.

Q: One instructor once said the reason I am incorporating so many positions in this 1 1/2 hour class is to tell you and show you as many good postures as possible for when you go home ideally each pose should be minimum 3 - 10 minutes. In that way you allow the body to relax, relief and then stretch. [continues monologue]

A: [asks host if she has We Want To Live books][Tells lady it is on Amazon and WeWant2Live.com]. It is not my website. I have somebody who I have contracted to do it, to publish my stuff. They have to take care of it. I don't take care of that website.

Q: [long inaudible comment/question]

A: Where are the vertebrae that are tight on you?

Q: [long inaudible statement]

A: Or is it that you are just getting better? It may have to do with your body getting healthier. Just try those two positions

Q: [discussion between yoga lady and person with back trouble]

A: I don't think we should get into judgements like that. We don't want to theorize about that. Just remember this: You don't have to go onto your back first if you don't want to. I will usually start on my side [demonstrates] and then I will roll back. It is easier if you go into it from this position.
If you are on your left side, the right shoulder goes back... these two opposite... This goes forward, this goes backwards [further demonstration, describing it]. On the right side, the left knee goes forward, the left shoulder goes back, the knee goes forward.

Q: I will remember that.

A: It is so easy. That one will give you so much relief! I should say gives me so much relief. It is my favorite. It is the only one I absolutely do every day.

Q: It is kind of like the diet. At first, you resist then you say ‘Oh that is helpful’ then you move to... I have so many rituals I do now. I had occupational therapy over a year ago and I do it every single day because I need to do it for my arthritis. So I just find that I just add - when I am ready - I add one more thing. And then it is not so difficult because I imagine it was not so difficult to start the diet to begin with.

Q: [inaudible statement/question]

A: Do you have a question, Joseph?

Q: Yes, I am trying to get a healthier floor covering in my house over the carpeting that is in there. Half my house is tiled; the other half is carpeting.

A: What kind of carpeting - wool?

Q: No

A: Synthetic?

Q: Yeah.

A: You are breathing plastic...

Q: I am trying to get rid of it. And also in my apartments too, I want to get rid of carpeting. I've been looking at doing some tile wood. But what I am finding in wood, or laminate floor, I am not sure which this is. It might be laminate... But what I am finding is the finishes on all these wood products that you can put in a house in a convenient way that is flooring it without gluing it to the floor and would be glued to each other or they are locked. They all have aluminum oxide! That can't be too healthy, can it?

A: Not if it flakes, if it oxidizes.

Q: It is already oxidized. Its already aluminum oxide. It is in the finish.

A: Yeah, I mean when the finish starts oxidizing into powder you may be breathing that.

Q: That seems like it eliminates all wood.

A: I have people that just use coconut oil. And finish the wood with coconut once a year.

Q: This stuff is already finished.

A: What I do... In the place I just got... it is all plastic carpeting... So I pulled the carpet out and I put stone on it.

Q: It seems like stone and tile are the only things out there.

A: ... not even tile, because tile is fired plus you've got lead; you've got all kinds of stuff in there.

Q: No, that is no good either. What about stone having radon?

A: You have to have a radon machine there to test if you have got parts that have radon. Or put those off in another area where people don't walk and don't live.

Q: What stone would you choose?

A: Whatever stone you like.

Q: Were do you get the stone without any ...

A: Do you mean radon?

Q: Yeah.

A: Well, almost all stone has some radon... or marble.

Q: There is nothing that is out there.

A: You can go through each... the one I bought was Venetian style which means there was one block this big and then another block this big and then 2 squares this big and another two sections that were like this. So that was the pattern. So that is all throughout the house that way. ... probably this thick. ... not very expensive. I got it at something like 20% discount. She has ...

Q: ... can't think of the name...

A: ... that is tight together. Mine has grout in between and there is a larger space in between.

Q: Travertine

A: Travertine, yeah, It is more like marble. It has a solid finish. It will show... Mine is a rough stone and I don't seal it. So it never looks dirty. And it is all mottled.

Q: Is it still releasing that...

A: If there were a section with radon it would constantly be distributing, but I put all the blocks that were radon in the [inaudible] closet.

Q: How did you test it?

A: It was a machine. I rented one.

Q: It was in a pack so you could remove the ones that had more?

A: Yeah, you can [inaudible] put that one aside and don't use it or use it in a storage area.

Q: What's the [inaudible] with what do you call it?

A: Radon can cause different types of diseases, depending upon your body.

Q: How bad is the lead [inaudible]?

A: It is not so bad. It is just that if something scrapes the glaze on it, it is very toxic.

Q: ... when the tile cracks?

A: When it cracks, you scrape it. You release some of the gas from it. I would rather have rock than I would a fired glaze. I would always rather deal with some natural stone than I would some fired glaze.

Q: What kind of stone did you get?

A: I forgot the name of it.

Q: You could possibly get wood that doesn't have it but it will be fixed up and you've got to [inaudible] - not that convenient.

A: I have had several people who put wood flooring in, with no finish on it, and I have re-finished it.

Q: I haven't been able to find any good wood...

A: Go online... ... no finish, unfinished...

Q: You put the coconut [inaudible]

A: ... coconut oil. In the Philippines, in some of those tribes people lived in their little grass huts... They will take grated coconut and they just work it in and work it in and work it in. But I like the oil. It is easy. Just put it on and it will absorb then wipe it off.

Q: … just coconut oil?

A: You do two coats the first time and then you just do it once a year. ... bamboo, because they use a lot of glue; there is epoxy in it - not so good.

Q: These [inaudible] floors all have engineered wood behind, underneath them.

A:... all toxic.

Q: ... all bad?

A: ... all toxic.

Q: You are making it really difficult for me.

A: Well, your easiest is stone. It is so easy.

Q: It is not easy to install, especially on floor surfaces that are uneven. You've got concrete in some places that I have that have wood floors. They are not even at all. Sometimes you have this much cement and other times this much.

A: Yeah but then you put down green board. And then I leveled it.

Q: One time we had to put plywood first and then your cement poles.

A: You don't have to put the plywood

Q: The floor wasn't strong. Carpet forgives everything. ... and it can do anything.

A: Yeah, unless you are using travertine like here where everything is [inaudible] together. But I use... mine is on concrete. And it has all different kind of rolls on that floor.

Q: Did you [inaudible] on it?

A: Yes, only 1/16 of an inch. The edges were beveled in the one I chose so it is really rough. So, even though they would be butted up together, they wouldn't be the same height. So they are open and you've got grout in between... it doesn't show; it forgives everything.

Q: Does it look OK for tenants?

A: Oh, mine looks so rich.
Q; What did you finish it with?

A: I didn't finish it.

Q: You didn't have to finish it?

Q: Which stone did you choose?

A: I forgot the name of it. It was a Venetian pattern but I forgot the stone. But it was on the light side, kind of off white.
[gap in the recording]

Q: Can that [egg white] sit around and [inaudible] more that just right immediately? Can you eat it later in the day? ... or the next day?

A: It can but I wouldn't do it more than 24 hours. I'm sucking eggs all day long so I just put a little bit on there, hold the eyelid down, rub it on the white, hold it up and roll my eye around.

Q: That was a routine I stopped doing; I am not interested in doing it again.

Q: Can we talk about some better eggs somewhere?

A: I am already getting them.

Q: How do you get them, without going all the way to Los Angeles?

A: Somebody is going to have to take a trip up to Los Angeles. You order them then somebody go up and pick up - lets say - 30 or 40 dozen. I've done it several times. $8.00 a dozen. ... from Pennsylvania, Amish farmer.

Q: Amos Miller?

A: No, Eli Miller [note, in 2020 it is Willow Run Foods].

Q: Are they trucked in?

A: Trucked, Yeah.

Q: What about the ones at the Farmers Market?

A: None of those are good. This guy doesn't feed any soy, he only feeds them what he grows. We KNOW how good it it. We know there is no arsenic in it, we know there is no mercury in it.

Q: Can you supply all the stuff to Cynthia [inaudible]?

A: Absolutely.

Q: ... and coconut cream?

A: They just found somebody that is willing to juice it so we will have that soon.

Q: The machine?

A: They are just going to use the Green Star right now.

Q: [inaudible]

A: ... that is what James did for years until I imported the stuff from Thailand but that is quite a bill - expensive. Probably about $15,000.

Q: Do you think that James' coconut cream is different? [inaudible]. ... freezing [inaudible]

A: Can't freeze it. [inaudible]. [James] has a freezer there for ice cream and stuff but he never puts it in the freezer.

Q: ... the coconut cream tastes different...

A: ... different coconuts... from Costa Rica, from Nicaragua, from Honduras.

Q: [inaudible] the pulp to coconut cream...

A: I told him that he should not filter it. If you want yours filtered, filter it.

Q: So, the coconut cream that comes from James has all got the pulp in it?

A: ...some in it. ... because the machine allows some of it to get through. I asked him not to filter that. He liked that because it was easier to do.

Q: Did he sometimes add some of the pulp to...

A: No

Q: ... because sometimes it feels like there is more pulp in there.

A: You may have gotten the bottom being put into the jars... when being put into the jars, they have gotten to the bottom of the bucket.

Q: He doesn't put any of the dry stuff in there...

A: No

Q: How does he get the pulp in there to start with?

A: Just like it gets through your juicer when you are juicing your...

Q: ... a certain amount ...

A: A certain amount gets through.

Q: ... because of the small holes.

A: Yeah.

Q: The thing is though, if it is not mixed in well, [inaudible] it is just more pulp.

A: You may have gotten one of those

Q: Yeah, it is not really a balanced coconut cream pulp.

A: Those are the two ways [inaudible] when they are jarring it. They are not going to stir it every time they go like this.

Q: Well, you would think that is what they would have to do to make it a uniform...

A: Yeah but they are not going to do that. It takes somebody to be very very conscious about it.

Q: Sometimes it tastes more of cream and sometimes more fiber.

Q: [other voice] ... but generally it is pretty good.

A: it is always good, even with the pulp in it.

Q: I have no complaints...

Q: [new voice] I do. It is supposed to be organic...

A: No, Coconut is the only thing that doesn't have to be organic. It has all of this fiber around the nut and all that fiber and almost all of that stuff gets locked into fiber.

Q: They probably don't use pesticides...

A: [inaudible] ... a web up in there to keep the inflorescence from being pollinated. There are spiders, there are some lizards that get in there and make nests and do some damage. It depends on where. It is a simple organic problem.

Q: I know years and years ago, like 20 odd years ago in Australia, before all those Americans were visiting as tourists, coconuts were everywhere, you know. People could go and either climb or get a big pole and cut them down. Then local council people going up with their machines and cutting off the fruit thing so there wasn't any more coconut. You could go and get... I used to get 20 coconuts a week.

A: ... The same way in Bangkok and a lot of the larger towns in the Asian countries, you could buy your coconut right on the street. Now you can hardly find it anywhere ...because they don't want them. They don't want good food in there.

Q: ... and also they might fall you see ...

A: ... and kill people. But I mean getting them from somewhere else and bringing them into the city. They don't want the street vendors.

Q: So we are really moving away from natural...

A: Absolutely. Everything is industrial. The first time I went there - 7 years ago - and the difference between those seven years is astounding. ... more metropolitan,

Q: ... in Bangkok...

A: All over the big cities in Thailand. ... in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rei...

Q: Chiang Mai used to be a little village, a mountain village.

A: Three million people in that city now. Thirteen million in Bangkok. Nobody is on the farms any more. They don't have anybody to work the farms. Kids don't want to go work the farm - no money in it. The thing is they use the same plan that we have here. You have these big companies that buy up the food for almost no money then charge a fortune to distribute it all around. And the farmer doesn't make any money. And nobody wants to be a farmer. But I know how sky high food is going to be so I own 2 farms now. I am not giving anything to a distributor. I will sell right to the people, like in a farmer's market or someplace like that.

Q: Will they allow farmers markets?

A: Well, when people are so hungry and poor they are not going to be able to stop that. You just won't be able to take it into the big cities. Just go on the outskirts.

Q: What will you grow?

A: Well, in Thailand right now I just have coconuts and papaya and rice. The rice... I already bought it, ordinary rice, so I am converting the rice paddies slowly [inaudible] and also I took two of the rice fields out and have a pasture area now for animals. I have 3 cows and a horse. I bought those just the day before I left.

Q: Any chickens?

A: Not yet. I will get them. In 3 or 4 weeks I will.

Q: Why a horse?

A: To get around the property. It is 34 acres so it is not small but I would need to get around. And I don't want to take my 4 wheel drive everywhere.

Q: Or your bicycle?

A: Well, I've got no paved roads. With the raining, your bicycle would go right into the mud. A horse is nice.

Q: You've got 3 cows!

A: Yeah, 3 cows. In the Philippines, I have coconuts, jack fruit, cashews and mangoes.

Q: What are cashews good for?

A: They are a good starch. They help pull toxins out of the body. Make it into a nut formula. I've just cleared 10 acres for animals. I am fencing that in the next month. I am finishing my house there in the next month.

Q: Why jackfruit?

A: Jackfruit is very fatty.

Q: [inaudible]

A: That was in Thailand. The one I am talking about now is in the Philippines. The one with the cows and stuff - that one is in Thailand. ... where they tried to take 2/3 of my land.

Q: Jackfruit is really sweet.

A: It depends. It is a very fatty fruit.

Q: You can eat it when it is not so sweet in a small [inaudible] and it is really meaty.

A: It is all meaty; it doesn't matter if it is sweet or not. A lot of times it will get fermenting sweet and there is too much alcohol in it.

Q: It is probably not too dry with fat in it. What was the other one? Cashews?

A: ... jackfruit, cashews, mangoes and coconut. And I am going to plant a lot of durian fruit. I love durian. It stinks like hell but I love it.

Q: It does stink! [Aajonus laughs]. What is so good about durian?

A: ... fat, high in fat.

Q: ... and mangoes

A: ... mangoes for cleaning the body, but eat them green. Those were already growing.

Q: [different voice] I have a question about mangoes. I made that mango smoothie formula and I ate it [inaudible] ... a detox.

A: It detoxes the chemicals... formaldehyde. It can detox any chemical. It is a solvent extractor. It could be novocaine, novocaine gas, xylocaine gas. All that stores all around in here. ... and you were a dental assistant.

Q: [different voice] Whenever I go through a detox, the next week I wake up and thought 'Oh, yeah, this is connected to when I had my tonsils out when I was 5.' And then they burn, like I talked about. They used chemicals in my throat. And whenever I get anything in my mouth, my whole throat goes [inaudible] all that stuff. How long will that take me...?

A: 14 years.

Q: Where is it buried?

A: It is buried in the tissues and the bones - everywhere. ... in every cell.

Q: ...you get stuff in your throat and your nose...

A: ... dumping out through the mucous membrane.

Q: It is in the skull too and comes out like this granular thing...

A: If you put hot water bottles at your neck at night and cover this area with a towel, you can still breathe through your nose. You will cause yourself to perspire it out through your skin quicker without causing it to go out the throat. Right now it is not getting out through your skin very easily. It needs to melt down so it goes out of your tongue and your throat.

Q: How do you put those hot water bottles around you?

A: Just put them on the side and then you trap the heat in with a towel or shawl or something like that.

Q: [long inaudible monologue]

A: No, you just have to live through it. It has got cream in it already.

Q: I stopped it and I was watching it and [inaudible] any more.

A: Well, just drink as much as... if you can only drink 2 ounces, then only drink 2 ounces.

Q: ... and then as you go through it...

A: Just do it. If you have that kind of reaction, I would do it before you went to sleep and then have the hot water bottle ... unless you could take a nap after having it so you perspire it out.

Q: What if burns...[inaudible]

A: Then just use less... an ounce... That is a hell of a way to make it.

Q: ... the cream after [inaudible] through the membranes . What do you do to soothe the membranes?

A: ... butter, that is always the best.

Q: [long inaudible question]

A: Your body may have used it somewhere else, in your system, in your skull, your throat.

Q: [inaudible] What is it about the winter... ?

A: When your body is at a high temperature, it heals better. When it is cold, it detoxifies you quicker.

Q: [inaudible] Why is that?

A: … because the body can dump the poisons without as much swelling.

Q:… oh, when it is warm, not when it is cold.

A: When the body is cold, it detoxes more and there are fewer symptoms. When you have swelling, you feel things more, especially when you are not perspiring. People perspired properly when they weren't eating all that hydrogenated vegetable oil plastic, then they probably had the same kind of detoxes all year 'round. But here in the winter, your body cleans the fats out of the body. It has to get rid of the old fats. ... especially if they are highly toxic. It has to change over the fat in the system.

Q: [inaudible] ... stay in another motel and as soon as I walk into the room I can smell these cleaning chemicals. [inaudible] while here I am in the room trying to detox chemicals...

A: Do you know the hotels you go to ahead of time?

Q: In [inaudible] springs, I do...

A: Call them ahead of time and say ‘don't clean it for a whole day; don't let anybody clean in there with any kind of [inaudible]. You can use a vacuum cleaner, you can use a rag and water, you can even use vinegar and water ... but that is as toxic as you can go. I don't want any clorox in there.’ ...no chlorine of any kind. Then they always take care of it - and I travel all over the world and they always take care of it.

Q: ... and they do that for you.

A: Absolutely.

Q: Oh, wow!

A: They will not clean that day with chemicals. One time in Bangkok they did it. I got there and I said 'I can't handle this room; I told you not to do it.' So they take me to 5 different rooms. They had to take me to an executive suite that hadn't been cleaned. It was a very high priced room and nobody had rented the high priced room so I got a high priced room.

Q: Do you use white vinegar?

A: I don't care what kind they use. I won't clean with white vinegar because it is distilled vinegar.

Q: ... but if they use it...

A: It dissipates within probably 20 minutes.

Q: Is there something you can use to spray out the chemicals? Nothing?

A: It is going to outgas in there until it is outgassed. Get enough oxygen in there. I always pick a hotel that has a window. If there is no window to open, I don't go to that hotel.

Q: Does apple cider vinegar clean just as well as white vinegar?

A: I think better. It leaves a film though. There is a slight bit of oil in it. White vinegar has no oil.

Q: On windows too?

A: If you do it with windows, you are going to get a film unless you clean it.

Q: [inaudible]

A: I don't use white vinegar in my house.

Q: How do you clean...?

A: I use Bio-Kleen. [note: since that time, Bio-Kleen started using chemicals] and a squeegee.

Q: When you are breathing...

Q: When you are breathing [inaudible] detoxing... the new stuff coming in, is that [inaudible] rapidly as you are detoxing?

A: It goes in, does its damage, then will have to be put into cycles of...

Q: If you have body fat though, drinking cream [inaudible] inhaling..

A: What you inhale is going to go in. Your body has to isolate it and separate it. It has to do all that, yeah, but at least you will have the fat to bind with it. Otherwise it is going to go into the cells. There is nowhere else to put it.

Q: [inaudible]

A: When you inhale it, some of it is going to go into the tissue, into the nerve fluid. It is going to go into the lymphatic fluid or the blood fluid. ... or into the lung tissue itself.

Q: [inaudible]

A: ... all over your body. Whenever I order online and make a [hotel] reservation, I always put in there - backside of the hotel, off the street. I don't care if it is an alley. I am off of the main street I want the back and a window that opens and no chemical cleanser. None. Use white vinegar maybe - but that is it.

Q: ... power lines don't bother you?

A: No other cities have it. I haven't run into it around hotels. I haven't seen any big electrical units around a hotel.

Q: And you take your sheets.

A: Yes, I take my sheets, my organic kind of sheets.

Q: Where do you buy that organic cotton sheet?

A: G A I A M .com

Q: You can get some locally too, at [inaudible].com in San Diego.

Q: What was the combination again... kiwi, mango and [inaudible].

A: Well, there are a lot more ingredients in it that that.

Q: ... honey, cream, butter...

A: It is a little bit of mango, a little bit of kiwi, honey, coconut cream, dairy cream, a little bit of lime, a little bit of lemon. Blend it all together then pour that into sparkling mineral water.

Q: ... oh, in mineral water. [inaudible] getting around chemicals...

A: Yeah, but, see, with the naturally sparkling mineral water, you have a hydrogen peroxide effect - natural hydrogen peroxide - which bleaches and breaks down toxins. It neutralizes and separates them so they are not so toxic. So that is why you put it in 2 1/2 ounces of sparkling mineral water.

Q: [inaudible]

A: Yeah, it will have but you are supposed to pour it into the sparkling ...

Q: [inaudible]

A: It[?] is delicious but it is very toxic.

Q: What is this a recipe for?

A: ... getting more toxic solvents out of the body: formaldehyde, gasoline, antifreeze, alcohol... anything damaging to your body.

Q: ... all of the above.

A: All of the above, absolutely.

Q: [comment about the room]

A: This room echoes.

Q: What do you do if your tissue is internal and it is cauterized? You don't worry about the wound healing? [inaudible] olive oil?

A: No, olive oil or any of your pressed oils is a puller - it helps pull toxins out. If you want to protect your skin, and the insides - the mucous membranes and tongue - BUTTER. That is the only thing that is going to really protect...

Q: ... that is better than cream?

A: Cream will do that too.

Q: What does the dryness come from?

A: Any time your toxins are [inaudible]... let's say you have a toxin of mercury that was in a nerve then all of a sudden it is coming out of your gum - your body has to use from 50 to 200 molecules of fat to harness that one molecule of mercury so all of a sudden you go dry. And you look at people and you say 'where do they go dry first?’ They start wrinkling in their face because the brain is 60 to 80 percent fat so that is where a lot of toxins go, and when the brain detoxifies, where does it detoxify? ... tongue, gums and salivary glands.

Q: [inaudible]

A: Yep. That is why it goes in the face first, and neck.

Q: It is a toxin?

A: Toxins leave the brain, ripping all the fats. So you are fat-deficient in the whole face.

Q: Can you put that Primal Cream...?

A: ... that is for detoxing and nourishing the skin. If you only want to nourish it and get rid of wrinkles and stuff like that, just put bone marrow or bone marrow and butter. Do you have another question:

Q: Why does having too much cream cause osteoporosis?

A: Any kind of ... When your body utilizes fat in the body, it needs a certain amount of protein to utilize it. Also, it needs a certain amount of minerals. It is very mineral-deficient. It causes the water ... need for minerals... So, if you are eating a lot of cream that is difficult to digest already, then you've got a mineral deficiency or you are not keeping up with eating enough cheese, then you are going to have a mineral deficiency. But you will do that by eating any kind of oil or any kind of fat.

Q: ... even avocado?

A: ... even avocado.

Q: ... can also create osteoporosis?

A: Correct. Usually with avocado, your teeth will go first.

Q: How do you mean your teeth will go first?

A: You will start demineralizing your teeth. And then it will go into the bone after that.

Q: So, is cheese the only thing that is bringing back minerals?

A: Well, raw unsalted cheese will not. When you have raw unsalted cheese with some honey, you will digest the minerals.

Q: Are there any other foods to help with minerals?

A: ... milk, milk, milk, milk... tons of minerals in it. It is the most concentrated in minerals of any food. ... except bone, but we can't digest bone.

Q: If you are eating the cream with the milk, it is a balance, right?

A: It depends on how much cream you put in.

Q: How much cream can you put in?

A: It depends upon the quality of nutrients that that animal is getting and how minerals are in the feed, in the grass that they eat. It depends upon - let's say they are eating all the young grass. If they are eating all young grass and not old grass, it is going to be very mineral deficient. Just like wheat grass - very mineral deficient.

Q: So then you are looking at different seasons,.

A: Well, usually when you are taking a cow and you are pasturing them, you put them in the tall grasses and let them eat it down. You don't put them in the young grass. Let your grasses get tall, at least up to waist level. Amish farmers wait until it is shoulder or head tall. There are lots of concentrated minerals in there. Just think about this: as a blade gets taller, it needs to be firmer and sturdier - like a building. You need more and more structure the taller it gets, firm rigid frames. And the plant will be the same thing. If it has the same mineral concentration as when it is young, the wind will just knock it over, just gravity will push it over. So it gets firmer in minerals as it grows. Then of course as the animal eats the more mature grasses, it gets more minerals.

Q: Can you talk about eating oysters?

A: Oysters are the only shellfish I know that don't build any... don't allow any of the toxins to settle into the meat. Mercury and the other metals the toxins are in are in the oceans and in fresh water. The oysters build it all into their shell. Clams, scallops, none of the others do it. The toxins go into the shell so when you eat the meat of an oyster, you will never get any toxin. It will just pass through you, not like what happens with the others. The oyster has the ability because it can do that, can help detoxify heavy metals out of the human body faster - and I mean 5 times faster -with very few symptoms.

Q: ... that is live oysters

A: ... not even live oysters. I have had people buy them in jars that are 5 days old. ... and it worked. I didn't think it would work but it did.

Q: Do you mean cooked oysters?

A: ... no, not cooked.

Q: ... raw oysters?

A: Yeah. You can go to a store and buy them already shelled in a jar.

Q: Will there be laws to allow it? I remember reading in [inaudible] they had a section on they want further processing of all oysters. What is the further processing?

A: Yeah. The further processing would be spraying it with one of those new viruses - one of the 6 viruses the FDA approved. And virus is nothing but a chemical solvent. So it is a chemical - toxic. But if you can, go to a place that does their own jarring, like a seafood market or a seafood place that does their own shucking.

Q: You are saying that oysters that are being shelled and put in a jar, they are really good for detoxing heavy metals.

A: ... any kind of metals.

Q: ... any metals.

A: The way I first discovered it was - every time I would eat a lot of oysters - because when I go to Asia, I eat a lot of oysters... And now that the price is so high, they are even more expensive there than they are over here now. But when I was going over there first, I noticed that the metal that showed up in my irises was remarkably less every time I went through a time of eating a lot of oysters. I had one woman who was born and raised in the heart of London... and there are 4 airports. So you've got 4 airports dumping their benzene all over the place over London. And she looked like a lathe operator. She had so much metal in her system she was chronic with fatigue, fibromyalgia, emotionally distraught, imbalanced, couldn't stay on and off the diet. Nothing would satisfy her. So after about 2 years of all that mess, I said 'you need to do something radical. so give this a try'. She wouldn't eat the high meat, but high meat was really not her problem. She needed to remove the metals. So I said 'take a half a cup of red meat, ground would be better because I don't want you to spend a lot of time on digestion, and eat 3 oysters twice daily, 6 days a week and on the 7th day eat chicken or whatever you want with that beef or eat no beef and just eat chicken and some other kind of fish, some other kind of seafood. So she did that solidly, religiously, for a year. And when she came back - usually it takes people 3 to 5 years for metal to remove - she removed it in one year. It changed her whole life. She became happy, she was solid, she could have a relationship, she wasn't emotionally moody...

Q: What did she need the oysters for - fat?

A: I said she had to have a half a cup of red meat, and the three oysters and of course at least a tablespoon of butter.

Q: ... can you shuck them yourself? Is that a good idea?

A: Absolutely.

Q: ... not sea water...

A: Well, it is but the oyster has sucked it up through the back end and has filtered out most of that sodium. But, like I said, it has filtered out everything so even the metals that are absorbed when it eats that water are filtered into the shell.

Q: So that would be good to drink?

A: Yeah. If you get headaches, then it wouldn't.

Q: I ended up getting some incredibly large ones. The medium size was 5 or 6 times what you would get.

A: Just make sure they are not on the gulf side of the [inaudible]. You have to have them from the Pacific side.

Q: I didn't know that. I can't imagine they would be from the Pacific side.

A: No, not necessarily. If they are from the gulf, don't eat those now.

Q: Are they toxic?

A: We had that oil spill in the gulf. It contaminated all the gulf, even all the way on the outside. And all that stuff went all the way up as high as Georgia. Some people are even claiming it went up above Savannah and up into the Carolinas.

Q: ... you said about headaches...

A: If it causes too much sodium out of the brain, to detox out of the brain, you might not want to drink the water, the liquid from the oysters.

Q: ... because that water detoxes sodium?

A: It detoxes sodium pretty heavily. There is a lot of sodium in that water... a lot of mineral content.

Q: What does it detox?

A: Sodium from the brain. In some people, sometimes.

Q: [inaudible]

A: Yeah, if you can deal with the headaches. There are easier ways to detoxify slower. But some people are so toxic that they have to detox with headaches.

Q: So, if you do get a headache, what is a good way to detox?

A: Well, like I said, the headache formula is in the book, which is mainly lemon and honey and water, sparkling mineral water. But some people need cream with it. It just depends.

Q: I have had good luck with oranges.

A: Yeah, some people do better with orange than with lemon. It just depends upon the individual. And that is what you have to test. That is why I give 4 remedies for a headache. So you have to find the one that works for you. And at different times, it could be different kinds of a headache.

Q: In your book, [inaudible].

A: No, that is changeable so I've got a product list https://www.primaldiet.net/shop/primal-diet-tm-raw-food-list-2020/ that is $15. It has the products in it. You can get it on the [PrimalDiet.net] website. Or in the back of the book, there is a form. You can fill it out and send it in.

Q: ... finding food sources in your area

A: Well, with that list, it makes it very easy.

Q: [inaudible] read your book?

A: … at least the first book. I suggest you read both of them.

Q: And then, if I want to contact you...

A: Contact me, yeah. Now I am going away on the 17th of January, until June. Actually I will be finished with what I have to do by mid April but then I have to go to do a conference and to do two workshops, one in Capetown and one in Johannesburg. And then when I return here, two days after I return, I have to go to Philadelphia, then Chicago, then I am on tour here. I may have 2, 3 days here and there throughout the month of June.

Q: ... see patients...

A: You can come for a private consult. But I am saying I am only going to be available here until the 17th.

Q: for a consult, do we drive to L.A. or do you have someplace here in San Diego?

A: Well, I did mine today. When I come to the potlucks, I do them when I am here. So the next time will be in June when I am here.
Q; There was an email that said something about April, having another one here in April.

Q: [different voice] That was a typo. It was for today's. Then he didn't change the bottom part that said April.

A: Did I do that?

Q: You did that; it was so confusing.

A: I didn't even see that. Oh, my God.
Q :[group chatter about the email]

Q: I just met with John R. [Ra Health Foods co-op founder] on Thursday. Where do the eggs [delivered by the co-op] come from?

A: Eli Miller, a neighbor, yeah.

Q: They [Amos Miller and Eli Miller] just have the same name?

A: There are a lot of Amish people who have the name Miller.

Q: Is there a website [for the co-op]?

A: RAhealthyFoods.com [note: now, see farmmatch.com] Now as of the 15th, he [co-op organizer] will be a place in Santa Monica. … 27th street at the freeway. In that ARCO station there? On the south side of that station is a lot of paved area. So he is running that every Saturday so people can come close and not have to go all the way to Tujunga. In Santa Monica, Cloverfield and the freeway. It will be on Saturday.

Q: Is that going to like the deal with Rawesome so you order it a week ahead of time [inaudible].

A: Correct.

Q: [group discussion about co-op]

A: Well, if you want to switch, switch!

Q: [further group discussion about co-op]

A: You have to say what you want!

Q: [further long discussion about co-op]

A: Well, he's way over in Tujunga. He's near Pasadena. There are not that many people out there, on the diet. I told him he's going to struggle; he's got to get a place in Santa Monica, and he realized he had to. As soon as I put it out on my email to 5,000 people, he is going to be inundated because people don't want to go to James. I have people emailing me every week 'when is the other place going to open? When is the other place going to open?' Some people would rather go to Whole Foods than go to James because of what they did, the experience with bad eggs and chicken for 2 years. Poisoned for 2 years! At high prices! I'll sue him.. The suit gets filed on Tuesday.

Q: Many of us order directly from Amos rather than pay [inaudible] to go up there.

A: If you have him ship it out, it will cost a lot more.

Q: [more group discussion about getting food in San Diego] I want to be sure that I will be able to get coconut cream.

A: Well, you can have that after next week.

Q: Do they have a warm room to be able to do this up there?

A: In her home! She is doing it with a Green Star.

A: Green Star, yeah.

Q: [group long mostly inaudible discussion]

A: I told her until we get something else going, shop in his place; just don't buy his eggs and his chicken. I told everybody to continue to shop there; just don't buy the eggs and the chicken. But some people are so furious that they won't even shop there at all.

Q: [inaudible] is still getting eggs from there.

A: That is not good.

Q: I doubt anyone will be ordering after that last email you put out on that website [unhealthyfamilyfarms.com, no longer live]. Anybody who goes to that website won't be ordering eggs.

A: That's for sure.

Q: [loud lively group discussion about the conflict]


A: Anyway, I sent him an email and I said 'You have 2 days to retract this or you go on the lawsuit too because you just committed libel. You know why the website is there. I said I had no tests done because I am an interested party in this, I am not an independent party. These tests were done by these other people and they are all on the website. Not by me. And you said that this other woman was getting the tests done by me and talked with the laboratory. That is a complete fabrication and a lie! I didn't have any done independently with me. I had other people do them.’


Q: I didn't believe him on any of this stuff. [group talking at the same time, inaudible]

A: It is the same toxic stuff . Organic chicken is going to be sold.

Q: [group discussion] [inaudible]... we should go with them.

A: Yep, that is what I suggested.

Q: ... and you will tell Cyntha about that, right?

A: Cynthia... is she still around? I thought she was leaving.

Q: If you make it clear to her - because it seems she has allowed herself to be influenced and then she is stretching it [inaudible] but if you say to her OK now this other place is setting up that everyone is wanting, let's just switch over.

A: She got the email. I said don't buy the chicken and the eggs...

Q: ... She is stretching it! In her mind she is saying 'Aajonus said it is OK to order...

A: No, I did not. I didn't realize...

Q: But ...

A: I don't care if she is stretching it or not. That is not logical. I said do not buy the chicken and the eggs, period.

Q: She is allowing people to order the chicken and the eggs

A: That doesn't matter...

Q: It does matter!

A: No, that is her choice. I warned her. She is no better than James if she is doing that.

Q: That is exactly my point. She is misleading people. She said its OK. So she is telling...

Q: [heated group discussion] She is not willing to make that decision about the chicken and the eggs.

A: Well then I won't do any more potlucks at her place. If she is doing that, I am not going to support her.

Q: She is allowing herself to say I'm doing everything - everybody else makes the decision and she is not wanting to make the decision.

Q: [inaudible] blatantly she has said I don't believe Aajonus.

A: She made that statement?

Q: [everyone talking at once] In her mind she is saying I don't want to be in the middle of this but then she is taking sides. She is basically saying I don't believe Aajonus. So that means she doesn't want to take responsibility to make the decision to say I am done with James.

A: That is really sad because James has come up with no evidence. I said all you have to do is show us the receipts for the feed and the receipts for the chicks. That is all you have to do. He won't give up, not a one. They give no evidence. We've given all of the pictures, the photographs, the logic behind everything. ... how many chickens she had, how many she was selling per week, how many eggs she had produced from a few chickens, getting no chicks, then all the laboratory tests. All evidence.
Q; She doesn't want to take that responsibility. [group discussion]

A: Well, I am never going to do a potluck at her place again.

Q: [group discussion, people interrupting each other]

A: As soon as they get word that I am not doing it with her anymore, they will find out slowly but surely.

Q: Aajonus, is there any way that you can say to Cynthia 'Are you actually not wanting to relay... ' I want you to speak to her.

A: If she looks at that website and can't make a rational decision on that...

Q: [loud but unclear]

A: OK, I don't give a shit. Don't push me to do anything, OK? This woman is not being rational. And if she is attacking me by not being rational, when I put all this information out, she has a problem. I don't want to be associated with her. That is not confusion.

Q: [group discussion] [female voice:] She is not being grounded enough to say 'I don't really want to make that decision'. But you [Aajonus] directly say 'Cynthia - are you OK? because this is a truth. All these people who have been doing it for so long trusting you are all of a sudden wanting you to change over now that this other place is available. Do you want to do it? Because if you don't, then we won't have anything more to do with you. Stay with what you are doing and get the people who you want because we decided not to.' And I think it has to come from you [meaning Aajonus] otherwise she gets too easily influenced.

A: Well, as far as I'm concerned, my email was very obvious. If she has the same nature as James, there is nothing I can do about it.

Q: [long heated group discussion, many people speaking at the same time]

A: If she wants to come to me, fine. I don't have any - for somebody like that, who I helped out of cancer and is alive today - and she attacks me... When she says 'I don't believe Aajonus' she is attacking me. [lady objects] I don't give a shit. I have no compassion for her. I have no loyalty.

A: If she has no loyalty, I have no loyalty.

Q: ... your book.

A: I only have one of them here. My recipe book I have here in the car. The other one I don't have but you can buy that one.

Q: It has been wonderful.
