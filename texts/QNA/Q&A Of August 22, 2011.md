Location: Omaha, Nebraska

A: February. I spend more time in the Philippines, because I have three times more [unintelligible] there than I do, in the Philippines. I′m almost finished in the buildings there at the farm in Thailand.

Q: What part of Thailand are you in?

A: Do you know where Khong Than is? Do you know where Udon Ratchathani is? Korat?

Q: Oh yeah, Korat.

A: Okay, well I′m north of Korat about, do you know where Udon Thani is?

Q: Yeah.

A: 200 miles south of Udon Thani.

[unintelligible] 

A: That′s not far, yeah. Five hours?

[unintelligible] 

A: [speaks in thai]

Q: [speaks in thai]

Q: Okay, you guys, cut. Thanks everybody for coming. I didn′t get the buttons on the couches cleaned now, as I did two years ago.

Q: [unintelligible] 

Q: Are you sure?

Q: I appreciate that stimulus. 

Q: I wanted to read something, and you guys might remember this, but we′re all most appreciative of Mary Beth Clark, because she was the first one to bring Aajonus here. She wrote this, and it′s pretty cool. It′s called Food for Thought.How is it that people who eat fresh, organic food as close as possible to the source, exactly as it was created, are called extreme, even crazy, and people who eat foods from cans, cardboard boxes, and plastic containers full of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, colorings, and polymers, preservatives, bleaching agents, and texturizers that have been irradiated, pasteurized, and hydrogenated, and dehydrated, are called normal?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Well said.

Q: I just think that is so classy and it′s worth repeating. So, you know, food is our medicine, and Aajonus will tell us that, and that it′s our only medicine, and anyway, that′s what brings him here, so, but, you know, the most difficult part of the primal diet, and I think of Brian Wallenstein when I think of this, is saying the name Aajonus.

[laughter]

Q: I think it took me two years to pronounce that. Now I have some initial questions before Chrissy Ewing gets here. I get to talk first. I wanted Aajonus...

[unintelligible] 

Q: Thank you. The other one's on. I wanted to have, you know, if you've read his book, you know about flu and you know about head colds and stuff. But if you would talk again on that and to verify that he's saying it's not contagious. That's how I recalled it. Flu is not contagious and so on.

A: Let's do one at a time. Colds and flus are similar. Cold is either, it's always microbial. So you have bacteria, you have parasites, and you have fungus. All those can cause detoxification. Cold is usually 80-90% microbial, maybe 10% flu, and flu is solvent activity. Parasites can eat 100 times their weight in 24 hours and of course they go after dead or damaged cells. And the waste that they eliminate is 1-5%. So if they're taking 100% of something toxic and reducing it to 1-5%, that's the janitor I want. And they are janitors. You have janitorial microbes just like you have building microbes. We are 260 bacterial genes to every one human gene. We are 99.9% bacterial. So the whole idea that bacteria creates disease is absolute nonsense. The idea that a few thousand or even 200,000 microbes can take over all the microbes, the bacteria in the body, is ridiculous. It's ludicrous. The medical profession is just trying to hide their chemical poisoning of the planet, the human species, and the whole domesticated animal species, as bacteria when basically they create 70% of all diseases, mainly with vaccines. Vaccines have five basic ingredients, and even when we tell you there's no more mercury in it, they're lying. We've had five of the vaccines, including the MMR, that's supposed to be mercury-free. It's less mercury, it's about 20% less mercury, but before we were talking about 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury. Now it's 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury. Big deal. When it takes 50 to 200 molecules of fat to remove one molecule of mercury safely, it's going to take you a lifetime to get rid of one injection of vaccine mercury.

Q: How many molecules of fat do you need?

A: 50 to 200. You're going to have this taped so you can [unintelligible]. Otherwise, we will never get through this. With those kinds of poisonings in the body, that causes all this damage, biological, cellular damage, and even destroys bacteria. And if we have that much bacteria propelling everything, the energy we produce, it's all... bacteria is behind everything, absolutely everything. Intercellularly, they have a whole microcosm of bacteria of their own. So it's bacteria upon bacteria upon bacteria. And if you look at science, they say, what was the first thing on the planet? Bacteria. Everything is based on bacteria.

Q: The little bugs control our world, don't they?

A: Absolutely, completely. And to believe that a few janitorial ones, which they call pathogenic, create disease is insane. If you look at the proportions of disease that have increased as our dependence upon industry and chemicals and medications has increased, so has disease. In 1957, the rate of cancer was 1 in 1,000. Now it's 1 in 2 for men and 1 in 3 for women. How can you blame that on bacteria? We destroy bacteria every day with everything. So, the whole idea of that bacteria creates diseases is insane. So, of a group of bacteria, we have janitorial bacteria. When you take human cells or any animal cell, you put it in a petri dish, in a fluid that sustains the life, does not make it thrive, what have you done? You've taken it out of your natural environment. So, what is likely to happen? Microbial, janitorial microbes are going to grow. And they are going to eat those cells, those animal cells in that petri dish. So, the pharmaceutical and medical industry and scientists that work for them say, see, see, creates diseases, destroying, eating these good healthy cells. They are not in the human body, they can't be healthy cells. They are not in a blood stream flowing. They are sitting stagnant in a fluid that keeps them alive, but not thriving and healthy. So, this is the manipulation that goes on. So, when we go through a cold or a flu, we have these microbes, fungus or a microbe, that go in and eat up these damaged cells and tissue that needs to be recycled. If we don't recycle it, what do we have? Cancer. Cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve and eliminate dead cells. So, the body stores them as tumors. It works as moles on the most benign expression of that, of tumors and to the major fibroids and then the massive development of odd-shaped kinds of tumors that can block functionality. So, these janitorial microbes must get in there and break these cells down so that we work efficiently. If we don't break down the vegetation from one year to the next, we don't build soil, we don't recycle, it becomes stagnant, a desert. So, same thing in the human body. If you don't get rid of dead, damaged cells, you can't reproduce them. You don't have anywhere to go. And if you maintain dead cells, then what do you have? You have starches, you have bricks in the wall which are not alive. The bricks in the wall cannot create energy for you, they cannot grow hair, they cannot produce anything. So, we need those microbes. So, cold is primarily microbial detoxification. I told you about the parasites eating a hundred times their weight in 24 hours. Bacteria, janitorial bacteria like salmonella, campylobacter, strep, any of those can eat 50 times their weight in 24 hours, and their waste is only 1-5%. Great janitors. I prefer the parasites, they're faster and quicker and less symptomatic. 

When you have a parasite, you don't even know it, there's no sensation. When you have bacterial, you have the cold, you have the flu type, where the mucus is pouring and your nose and sinus is filling, and your lungs are congesting and coughing up the mucus. And fungal is the same way, it does that, but fungal is even more radical, it eats about 50 times its weight like the bacteria do, however, its waste products are 15-20%. So there's an increase. That's why when you get a fungal, yeast infection, anything like that, it itches. Because there's so much more waste that deprives the body and the surrounding area of so much more fat, so it dries those cells out, that's the itching. And the itching can drive you crazy, as you know. So, when we have flu, it's predominantly viral. Viruses are not alive. All the pictures you're seeing now, in the last 10 years of these viruses, hairy and all kinds of shapes, those are all computer generated. They're like Walt Disney making cartoons. No such thing. Viruses, when the area is so toxic, or the cells that have died or contaminated, are so toxic with industrial chemicals, that if the bacteria, parasites or fungus eat them, they're poisoned and they die. So, how does the body dissolve those cells? Cells, surrounding cells, or even the cells themselves, will create solvents. Muriatic acid, any kind of a solvent that does... Kerosene, gasoline, is what we use to dissolve things. Well, the cells make those to dissolve them. Now, what does it use? It uses water as the main product of solvent. You look in an archaeological book, the first thing under solvent is water. Water dissolves things. Water dissolves rock so that plants can eat, algae can eat. You see algae growing in a pond or on a waterfall, and you see them growing on a rock. They're there because they're eating that rock. And as the water flows down in the stream or over the rocks, the water dissolves the rock so that the algae can eat. That's the behavior of water. When it rains, it's water that dissolves earth so that the plants can eat. And some earthworms and microbes in the earth will also eat as a response to that. There are worms that eat dirt. So those are larger forms, of course. They're all made of bacteria, everything is bacteria. So these solvents, when they dissolve cells, they're not alive. So what happens? High contamination. So it's like you taking muriatic acid and going out into your garage and cleaning up your oil on the pavement, and then you've got a bucket, two-gallon bucket, two-and-a-half-gallon bucket, of this contaminated oil along with the muriatic acid. There's no reduction in waste. So the body has to deal with all that intense toxicity. So how does it do it? It gets very sick. Like the difference between bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis.

The doctors, they don't like to touch viral meningitis because it doesn't react to antibiotics because they're not alive. Also massive amount of swelling. Most of the paralysis that happens from meningitis is from viral meningitis because all that fluid that causes the swelling. Tears the spinal cord, tears the axions and ganglia in the brain. And then you have paralysis and heavy scarring and damage throughout the system. So viral detoxifications are a consequence of our industrial pollution in everything. So is that clear?

Q: Okay, so when we get the excrement from the bacteria or parasites, is that what causes our symptoms?

A: No, no, no. The damaged area. The damaged area. The pollution that has caused the damage.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, those are the symptoms.

Q: Okay, so what actually causes the fever and the aches?

A: That's the cleansing process. The fever is necessary to... Whenever you have an intense cold or flu, you've been detoxing heavily for months, even up to two years. Then all of a sudden the body is going to dump the waste all at one time. If we were taking hot baths or hot tubs and perspiring it out frequently, and we didn't have all of the plastic oils blocking our skin and lymphatic system, these little beads of plastic, we'd be eliminating, we wouldn't suffer colds and flus, one time a year in the winter, when we couldn't perspire them out of the body.

Q: So what are the plastics that cause it? I know that margarine is plastic.

A: Any hydrogenated oil, and that's 99% of all the oils out there.

Q: So even the ones that are organic, like the canola oil, is that...?

A: Well, they're not necessarily hydrogenated, but they're still toxic. We can't digest oils.

Q: Okay, so the plastics, if we stay away from hydrogenated and...

A: Anything fried, anything that's produced that's in a package, they do it as cheaply as possible. So they get these oils that are not even food oils. And if they do get food oils, it would be something like soy oil, something that produces a lot of oil, mostly get it from mineral oil, from the ground that they distill and make from petroleum. So those oils, they hydrogenate them to give them a long life. Hydrogenation is a heat and pressure that they apply to oil to destroy all bacteria, all forms of anything that can decay. So basically you got a hundred million years shelf life. And that's all they're after. So anything that's fried, anything that's in a package that uses oils in it, are hydrogenated oils, plastic oil. And that's 99.9% of all packaged food.

Q: And so that gets in our system and we can't get rid of it until we take the hot baths?

A: Right.

Q: Because it won't, the body can't...

A: As it dehydrates, it turns into plastic beads. And you can't get those out of the skin. They'll clump together and they'll block the pores. And then even if you perspire, you're not going to perspire the heavier waste product, like from cells that have been dissolved and you've got a higher rate of waste, won't get through the cells or through the pores. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Hot tub, you need about 105 to 110 degrees for 90 minutes a day.

Q: What about sauna?

A: Sauna's too hot. Over 110 degrees, you damage the vitamins and the enzymes and a lot of other nutrients in the skin and under the skin. Steam is the same way. Plus, it heavily damages the mucous membranes. 

Q: Does it get the plastic out?

A: It gets plastic out. If you're in a sauna with steam, it'll take twice as long. Instead of 90 minutes, you have to look at 180 minutes because when you have air space, you have more of a cushion of air. The heat will be out here, and then your body will cool down to this point. So how long is it going to take that space to heat up over time without you moving? Once you move, you can feel the heat all of a sudden. The heat's real intense. When you're in water, you only have a half an inch to three-quarters of an inch buffer, so that heat's very close to your body. I mean, if you want to be in the sauna and steam bath walking back and forth the whole time, sure, you're going to pass out and fall over because they only allow you to stay 10 minutes in those without causing any serious damage. Because that heat goes in and damages the lungs, you stop absorbing oxygen. You'd better get the hell out of there. That's why they say only 10 minutes in the steam bath and 15 minutes, 20 minutes in the sauna. Depending upon the heat in the sauna. If you're in a hot tub, you can go to sleep in there and sleep in there 12, 15 hours if you want, as long as it's not over 110 degrees. I've done it multiple times. When I had cancer of the blood and bone [unintelligible], and after chemo and radiation, I mean, I couldn't, I was in such intense pain. I went to drown myself in the bathtub. Stayed awake for, well, I was only sleeping 10 minutes at a time, waking up in excruciating pain because they cauterized my spine with the radiation. And so I couldn't lie, I couldn't sit on anything that was moved. I had to lie on the floor. I had to crawl around on my elbows. And so I finally said I wasn't going to take it anymore. So I got in the bathtub to drown myself, and I fell asleep like I wanted to be drowned. I wake up two hours later freezing cold with no pain because my body's slightly buoyant in the water. And I realized, ah, hot baths. So I started living in the bathtub, you know. Changed the water every 20 to 30 minutes. I had a big clawfoot tub. So I would sleep 14, 16 hours in there and be painless. Hour out of the bathtub, I was in pain.

Q: How long did you do that?

A: Almost two years.

Q: Did you work during that period of time?

A: I couldn't. Well, I worked a little bit. I became an actor that doesn't have to do anything.

Q: So a sauna doesn't work?

A: Make a lot of money and do nothing.

Q: Because a sauna is like too hot? What if you had it at that temperature?

A: 105 to 110.

Q: Would that do it?

A: Saunas, again, you've got a huge buffer range. So you'd have to be in there, let's say. And a sauna at 100, they don't make them that low. The lowest is 134 degrees, and there's ultraviolet, infrared ones. The lowest they go is 134. But if you were in a 105 to 110 sauna, you'd have to be in there probably eight hours to do what you could do to 90 minutes in a hot tub.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Yeah, I think you used to sit in there for [unintelligible] half hours, though.

A: Then it was not the normal 160 to 180.

Q: It probably wasn't.

Q: We'd throw the water on.

A: That's a steam.

Q: Maybe it was a steam.

A: That's not a sauna, that's steam.

Q: Okay, so it probably wasn't a sauna. But the baths, you're right in that heat all the time, and you can stay in there for hours then.

A: Absolutely.

Q: No problem.

A: And would you get more of that plastic out of the system? Yeah, as soon as you get up to 105 degrees for 90 minutes. Well, for 40, 45 minutes, you can get that under the skin. That that goes deeper into the lymphatic glands and lymphatic nose, that takes a full hour and a half to get that deep. And then it's only melting just a little bit of it. You take a little bit out at a time.

Q: So if you stay in there longer, you could get it done faster?

A: Yes, absolutely.

Q: Well, why don't you take all of your food and stuff up in the bathtub?

A: That's what I did.

Q: So she's got to eat?

Q: No, I've got to... She's talking about the sports drink.

Q: What is that doing?

A: Sip it all through it.

Q: Yeah.

Q: See, she doesn't understand that you need... So explain that, why you need the sports drink, why you're doing that.

A: Well, we're going to go around the room here, so let's get the questions that you had written down.

Q: Last time I didn't get to talk, so there's a [unintelligible]. Okay, diabetes, I was reading in his book. Well, I know he quit cold turkey, insulin diabetic, when he was 16 after the polio attack.

A: No, 22. I got diabetes from getting the polio vaccine at 15 and a half.

Q: And weren't you on insulin then?

A: Yeah, I started insulin at that time.

Q: So, I couldn't quite understand in the book maybe how to get rid of diabetes. And I thought maybe there [unintelligible].

A: Well, honey doesn't eliminate diabetes. Honey is an insulin substitute rather than injecting it. When the bee collects the nectar, the bee swallows it. Goes around and collects more and swallows and swallows. Then it digests the pre-digested nectar. And it makes an insulin-like substance which converts the carbohydrates in the nectar into enzymes for digestion. Mainly for proteins and fats. Not for carbohydrates, although that's where it was made from. So, as long as the honey isn't heated over 93 degrees, it doesn't damage that insulin-like substance. So when the bee gets back to the hive, it vomits. That's what honey is. Nectar bee vomit. Pre-digested nectar. And that insulin-like substance can be utilized by diabetics when they don't produce their own insulin. So that's why I said a diabetic should be having a half a cup of honey a day. And I've had many diabetics go test their blood sugar and find that with all that honey they're eating, their blood sugar is way down. That's not what I look for anyway. To me, diabetes is, your pancreas doesn't work to the point of creating insulin to the point where you're not creating glycogen to feed the brain and the nervous system. What happens in the worst case of that is you can't absorb oxygen, you can't breathe, you stop functioning, you can't move. So, the true symptoms are not high blood sugar, and people shouldn't be injecting themselves based on that. They should be injecting themselves based on can they get out of the chair, can they breathe. That is true diabetic symptom. And yet they have people taking this blood sugar crap which is going to be skyrocketing anyway because the insulin forces the body to make a sugar molecule to break down that insulin. Because that insulin is a chemical insulin. Even if it's from a pig, they've dissolved the pig's organ in gasoline, hexane, which is gasoline, over a three day period, subject to 72 hours in that gasoline. Then they extract the insulin from that. So, insulin is from full kerosene or gasoline. If it's a natural one, then they've done it with kerosene.

Q: Where do you get your honey?

A: Whenever I can get it from a farmer that hasn't fed their bees sugar. I was getting it from Honey Pacifica. And when I heard that they were, when John called me, John Coe called and said, we had to feed our bees, you know, corn syrup this year. And I said, well, send me all you have. So I bought gallons and gallons of it. You know, and then started looking for other sources, and there are other sources here and there. So I've got gallons to last me until we get beyond that. That whole crop, that whole year is going to be, you know, produced from bees that are not very healthy. You know, Y&S, all those that haven't done that, they always leave enough honey in their hives. Honey Pacifica just didn't do it that year. 

Q: Is it going to be okay sometime down the road?

A: Probably another, yeah, next year, not this year.

Q: We have it in the house.

A: When did you buy it?

Q: Just recently.

A: Yeah, if you read my newsletter, you'll get all that data and information.So, that does not cure diabetes. What cures diabetes is good protein and fat. And Hippocrates, the so-called father of modern medicine, who said, let food be your medicine, medicine be your food, he reversed diabetes just by putting them on raw milk diets. They ate nothing else. We don't have that kind of access. They didn't have refrigeration. They got milk right out of the cow. All those growth hormones were present. You know, we're going to need meat and the dairy to reverse diabetes. But there are only a few cases where I haven't seen it reversed, and that's because they put children, you know, on like two or three years old, put them on insulin.

Q: Oh, no.

A: And, yeah, it's like their body has formed a situation where they have to take insulin for a long time.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I haven't found a child who will stay on the diet that's diabetic to do it because diabetics are emotional, you know, seesaws, up and down all the time. So when they do that, they just want to eat stuff that's not good for them. So it's very difficult to handle diabetics, you know, when they're that young. I have diabetics who have been on it for 37 years that are adults. They get on the diet, and one woman was taking 68 units a day for 37 years. Her sister was also diabetic, three years older than she was, and she had lost, you know, toes and a foot and then an ankle and the other side all the way up to the knee. And this woman was heading in that same direction just three years behind her, and she went on the diet. You know, she doesn't have to take any units, but she takes two or three a day just to make sure. And this one was in her 50s. But they had started, you know, on insulin like maybe 10, 12 years old. They weren't infants, you know, starting them off at two and three years old. That's criminal.

Q: [unintelligible] baby about 10 years ago, and she saw me.

A: So that's the diabetic question. Do you have some others?

Q: Have antibiotics ever helped anyone? And has a drug, a pharmaceutical drug, ever healed or helped anyone?

A: Well, pharmaceutical drugs are not made to heal anybody. They're made to keep you taking medication. All the books, all the procedure manuals for doctors were written by the pharmaceutical industry. Merck's was about this thick. And the word heal exists 53 times, always in connection with a wound or a surgical incision. Hello there.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: You made it?

A: Yes.

Q: Where's my paper?

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Good, how are you?

Q: Sorry, I was just at a four-year-old's birthday party.

Q: A four-year-old?

Q: Yes.

Q: Her four-year-old.

Q: I left you a message.

Q: Oh, you did?

Q: Yeah.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Oh, my God.

Q: Do you think [unintelligible]?

Q: Oh, that'd be scary.

Q: Yeah, it would be.

Q: How are you?

Q: I'm Christine. Nice to meet you.

Q: I don't know you.

Q: Oh, this is my sister.

Q: Oh, your sister.

Q: Yeah.

Q: Yeah, nice to meet you.

Q: Nice to see you.

[unintelligible]

Q: The question, he's gone over diabetes and colds and flus and stuff, and the question I just asked, since I didn't get to talk last time, is have antibiotics or pharmaceuticals ever really helped anything?

A: And I was just explaining that the Pharmaceutical Houses writes all of the medical procedure manuals for doctors and nurses, Merck's is about this thick. The word heal exists 53 times in it and it only applies to wounds, surgical wounds or whatever. The word cure does not exist in the whole book. They do not want you to get the idea that anything can be cured. They want you on medication for a lifetime, and that's their whole point, that's where they make the money, they're in business, hardcore, amoral, non-moral compassed idiots run it. So don't expect any medication to heal or cure you of anything. Antibiotics whether they work or not, think about it, if you're 99.9% bacteria and you're taking antibiotics, if you take 5 days of antibiotics, 5 day round of antibiotics, you've destroyed 1% of the entire body's bacterial environment. So think about that, 1% of your functionality. If you're on this diet, you can recover 2.5% a year. If you do some of the new stuff that I've come up with, you can do it up to 6-7% a year, cleansing but not healing. To recover, it's still about 2-2.5% a year to heal. So if you're breaking down in 5 days 1% with antibiotics, how is that helping you? What it's going to do is it's going to poison your system. Your system is going to stop detoxifying, which is the flu, the cold, whatever disease it is. It's always, your symptoms are always that of cleansing. The body is trying to get rid of the garbage that's causing the problems, your symptoms. So by stopping that, you're not going to get well. All you're doing is poisoning the body more. So the body is focusing on getting rid of that antibiotic out of the system, which is attacking it and destroying it. So people get relieved of symptoms, but they're not getting better. That's why people get sicker and more decrepit as they get older. 

Q: Is that why have [unintelligible].

A: Gangrene, yeah.

Q: [inaudible] Something like that. It is really nasty. Is that antibiotics?

A: Yeah, it is antibiotic, yeah, but it is... The body has to resort to a black fungus that breaks down walls, so-called inorganic material, because there's so many chemicals and damage, and the body's resorting to an environmental, rather than an animal, fungus to help it. The body will do whatever it can to try to survive and try to thrive, and we just keep attacking it. The medical profession, pharmaceutical industry gears us to attack the body, always attack it. The sicker you are, the more money they make. Of course that's what vaccines are all about. And you've got liquid mercury, formaldehyde, ether, detergent, and aluminum, mercury, detergent, ether, and what's the other thing. Yeah, although, yeah, I just named five, so those are the five. I was saying them faster than I was counting. So, if you've got all five of those in there as your basic ingredients, how can that be good, because they're all toxic on their own merit. Having it as a soup is ridiculous. Plus, they have up to 58 other toxic ingredients in vaccines. And the flu is the worst. It even has squalene in it. So, when you get those, your body's poisoned. Children get it. They have all these slight deformities. You see all these knock-kneed children, or bow-legged children, or, you know, deformed ears, deformed jaws. All of those are a response from that mercury and other contamination in there. But that creates the disabilities that the doctors get to treat, whether it's making your teeth crooked. Now, look at the amount of crooked teeth in people prior to 1940. Very minimal.

Q: Just in England, [unintelligible] the British [unintelligible] coal?

A: Coal. That's one of them, yeah. But you have to understand the king, queen of England run the world, basically. They own 70% of all food manufacturing in the world. They own 30% of the land mass, all in trust. So nobody knows that they are the richest. They hide it, but they really control the world. They got more money than the Catholic Church. They own more land than the Catholic Church. So, in fact, the popes used to get their money loaned from the crown, the royal family. So, they keep their people full of medication. They were the first to drill them. The Rothschilds were their agents in Europe. Princess Di was a Rothschild. The first Rothschild that they allowed to marry into the royal family. And they didn't like the way she handled it, so they got rid of her. So, in a very, very nasty way, but very blatant in a way, in a car crash like that. So, they do their dirty work there in England first, because those are their servants, their lackeys. And they've got everybody, just like the pope can do. Everybody praises them, adores them, oh, it's our king and queen. And they don't have a clue what this royal family is doing to them. Yet, the royal family has the best raw, organic, herd cows in the world. And all of the family eats only food that's grown there. They don't eat out anywhere. They always are served their own food. They take their own food with them. Reagan, Clinton, the same way, had their own ranches. We paid a million dollars each year to fly their food to Washington, D.C. And those people take care of themselves and don't give a shit about you, because you're just money for them.

Q: [unintelligible] doing the same thing. Executives are doing the same thing. They don't eat their food. They want their organic food grown. They're not going to eat the food they grow. So, crooked teeth. 

A: Crooked teeth come from vaccines, from alcohol, lots of cooked and processed foods. The more processed, the more likely the teeth are to be crooked. The vaccines are the worst. They get in there and damage genes more than anywhere else. Mercury is the most toxic neurotoxin on the planet to all animals. So it gets into the genetic structure and starts deforming everything. So, that's why they want to inject babies on their day of birth with Hepatitis B. They know that that baby is going to eat, consume, get five times more medical attention as it grows up than a baby that doesn't. 

Q: And you know it's under the guise of protecting that child.

A: Yeah. But now there's lots of medical doctors and other doctors who realize it's all a scam. And they're talking about it. You can see, I just watched the DVD two days ago in St. Louis where a multitude of, there were probably eleven scientists and MDs and different professionals even from the vaccine industry who are now whistleblowing on it. And you know how dangerous it is and there's no verification anywhere that it prevents a disease. In fact, just the opposite. You get more disease in the people who are vaccinated. Like in Appendix D of my book, We Want to Live, I show that polio vaccine, polio was literally almost gone by 1958 when they came out with the polio vaccine. And in the three states and one county that kept records, it went up almost 447% in one of those states. The cases of polio, and they were from people who got one to three vaccines. Nobody else was getting polio. Pardon me?

Q: What was causing the polio in the first place?

A: Canned foods.

Q: Good question.

A: Canned foods.

Q: I heard DDT also contributing to that.
 
A: Well, that was the theory, but not a lot of people were exposed to the DDT and still got polio. It was canned foods. King and Queen of England started World War II to get out rations. You remember all the... I guess not many people would remember it, not that old here. But anyway, the ad campaign was, support your loved ones fighting the war, eat canned foods. What the hell does canned foods have to do with supporting your loved ones in the war? And that was all the King and Queen of England's issues. Because, again, they owned 70% of all food production in the world, and they wanted people to eat this processed food.There weren’t people going out in their gardens. My mom was hooked on it. She didn't have to scrub any vegetables. She didn't have to chop anything up. All she had to do was open a can, dump it into a pot, and cook it.

Q: Which is why, what was the deal with it being canned that caused the problem?

A: The metals. Where the metals go, it also caused tonsillitis. Metals go into the tonsils and into the spinal cord.

Q: From the can itself?

A: From the can.

Q: Aluminum?

A: No, tin.

Q: Tin.

A: Tin is a highly reactive poison. Not as bad as mercury or thallium, but nearly. And they'll only put 10% tin. Tin does two things. It's an antimicrobial, and it's a hardener. So they put tin in all metals. I don't care if it's stainless steel, you've got tin in it. And it's highly poisonous. If you look up tin, you'll see how poisonous it is. You can't use over 10%, or you will be poisoned to death. And they were putting more than 10% tin in the tin cans. Because they wanted to have very thin tin cans, but hard. So they were poisoning people. So by 1960, and they knew that that created all the polio and tonsillitis, so they came up with plastic, 1959. And they started coating the inside plastic, in cans with plastic. Then you had the BPAs and the phthalates and all of that. Then you had people having problems with sexuality. You know, children were, males were born with breasts, and you had all that complication going on from the bisphenolphosphates. So, all of these reactions were all from industrial contamination. So, none of those drugs will heal anything or correct anything. They will balance the system, but not in a positive way. Not in a way that will get you to stop being a diabetic. They will keep you a diabetic. They will not, the cholesterol-lowering drugs won't correct your problem. They'll just keep you on cholesterol drugs for your lifetime. And that's what they want.

Q: What about high blood pressure?

A: High blood pressure, everybody who has high blood pressure needs high blood pressure. The body is brilliant, it knows what it's doing. You have to have high blood pressure if you're overweight and you have pressure on your veins. You better have high blood pressure, the blood's not going to get to where it needs to go. If you have any congestion, let's say you have plastic oils coating your veins and arteries, you better have high blood pressure or you're not going to get that blood through. People have high blood pressure for a reason. Correct the cause of high blood pressure. Don't try to lower the blood pressure because then you're going to create damage.

Q: So what's the cause then?

A: I just said. Overweight or pressure on the veins and arteries or veins and arteries that are blocked. They're congested.

Q: What about salt? Everybody's talking about salt.

A: Well, yeah, salt definitely increases blood pressure, but it usually creates mainly water pressure in the body. As you get older, it will create high blood pressure too. Now, 85% of headaches are caused by salt. And salt is again the way to make you sick. It also makes cooked food taste better. Because you eat cooked food that isn't salted, it tastes bland. It's awful. That's why spices and salt exist. To make cooked, bland, cardboard-tasting food taste good. Cook food and don't put salt in it and spices in it, and what do you have? The awful-tasting stuff in the world.

Q: So that's why I never miss salt when I'm not well.

A: Salt's an explosive. Salt is more volatile than nitroglycerin. When you isolate sodium, it is an explosive. The NSA, National Security Association Council, and the military department paid General Electric $2 billion over a 10-year period to make sodium into a weapon. My father was one of those scientists that were on it. It was so volatile that it would ignite with a degree-and-a-half temperature change when they had to isolate it. But one football size of pure sodium could take out New York City, and all of the buildings, one. So they wanted that as a weapon badly, but couldn't control it, thank God. They couldn't control it. Sodium, when it isolates in your body, becomes an explosive in your blood. So all of the, say, when your cells normally eat and your body forms food in the blood to feed the blood cells, whether it's red or white, you have a smorgasbord of nutrients, anywhere from 93 to 117 nutrients. So each cell, when it opens, it gets the whole smorgasbord, a whole balanced, complete diet. A whole balanced, complete diet. When salt goes in there, it starts exploding and fractionating these smorgasbords. So the cell may get 23 nutrients, 50 nutrients, but it never gets the 93 and 117 that it's supposed to get, to be balanced. So every cell is then malnourished. Eating disorders. Eating and eating and eating. Or anxiety disorders. And that's what they want. They want everybody to eat to get huge.

Q: You shouldn't eat salt at all.

A: You shouldn't put salt and it should not enter your body. It's rock. You don't eat salt. Plants eat rock, but if you give that lawn out there salt, what happens to it? It'll burn the roots. It'll destroy them. It'll just dissolve it. There are only certain plants that can live in salt. And those are the plants in the ocean. And in saltwater beds. On all of your salt beds that are land-based, there's nothing alive in those salt beds. It has to be in the ocean. Because the salt beds get too concentrated in sodium and just kills everything. Salt should not be near our food and near our body. Except in the bathtub to help pull poisons out.

Q: Isn't salt an electrolyte? And don't our bodies have electrolytes?

A: Only when it's in food.

Q: It's organic forming and coupled with carbon atoms.

A: Yes, but it's all linked in with food. But isolated...

Q: What about sea salt?

A: Same thing, it's rock.

Q: It's not any different?

A: No, it's rock.

Q: Sodium chloride.

A: Exactly, it's just rock. We don't digest rock. Plants can digest a little bit of sodium. Like I said, you put sodium out there the way we put it on food, and you're going to kill everything. You're going to kill that tree. And that tree is hardy. You will kill that tree. If a person puts as much salt as they eat in one year around that tree, the same quantity every day, it will destroy that tree. It will kill the roots. It will just dissolve the roots by explosive activity.

Q: So epsom salt in a bath is a good thing? 

A: Yeah, but that's mainly magnesium. That's not all sodium. That's very little sodium. And that helps draw. Even sea salt in a bathtub is good.

Q: Doesn't that pull the fat out of you, though?

A: It can pull the fat out of you. But when I say take a bath in with sea salt, you can also, say, put raw apple cider vinegar and milk in it, too. So you've got a balance there. But it'll keep the water hot longer.

Q: Will it?

A: Because it's an explosive.

Q: It might blow up.

Q: Well, I took Epsom salt baths before I did your diet, and Christy can attest to this. And I had, well, you remember, I had that colon issue, or gut issue, and I just, it burned, it just, I could feel it pulling it.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Oh, yeah.

Q: Yeah, I won't even touch Epsom salt ever again.

A: You put the milk in it, it's okay.

Q: I don't care.

A: Put the milk in the water.

Q: I do the clay, I'm sorry. I had so much pain from that that it was just incredible, so. I have other problems, though, so it wasn't just. If you were a healthy body, I don't know that it would have made much difference, but.

Q: Well, he has said he hasn't met anybody healthy enough to eat.

A: I wouldn't eat a human, not healthy enough.

Q: Thank God.

Q: Okay, so with the antibiotics, they are taking symptoms away, or masking symptoms.

A: Well, like I said. When you poison the body with antibiotics, you start killing the body massively with antibiotics. The body stops its detoxification of wherever you have those toxins. Okay, it stops the detoxification. Okay, and goes after it and tries to neutralize the antibiotics and get it out of the body. Okay.

Q: The immune system.

A: No such thing as an immune system. That's your body wanting to, I mean, that's the system wanting you to support the army and all the other aggressively imperialistic nature of governments that want to take over everybody. As Noam Chomsky said, the U.S. government has subjugated 167 countries in 110 years. The worst case we can do lately is Granada. Remember Granada? Little bitty country. Their military was 5,000 people. We send over 50,000 people, heavy ammunition, kill some of them and take over the country. In the name of democracy. And it's bullshit. They just want to take over the assets and run the country for their own corporate needs and wants and desires. The body is the same way when you look at it when somebody wants to control the body. It's the same issue. Oh, here it is. It's getting dry. This is kefir made on its own. Own bacteria in the milk, predigested for me. I suck.

Q: Immune system, explain to me...

A: There is no immune system. You have a lymphatic system. You have a lymphatic system. Your lymphatic system is responsible for cleaning all waste out of the body. If that goes bad and is congested because of the waxy, I mean plastic oils in the body, gets congested, it can't do what it needs to do. It's not cleaning the body properly. So the body starts storing toxins in your liver and they say, Oh, the liver is a filter. Absolute nonsense. The liver is the place to dump things in the whole body. You can dump them anywhere. You can dump those toxins anywhere in the body. Of course, each cell is going to react and try to thrive in the midst of toxicity. And they say all those reactions are the immune system, the body protecting itself. Well, hell, the body doesn't have to protect itself unless you're poisoning it with industrial toxins. So there is no real immune system. That's what they're creating out of this contamination of the body. We have the lymphatic system which cleans the system. That is the normal process. Get rid of the industrial toxins that do all the damage and contamination of the body, and the body will function without any defenses going on all the time. And they want you to think of the immune system like being an army. It isn't necessary. People thrived for millions and millions of years. I mean, look at the Maasai tribes, the Samburus and Fulani. All those tribes that were very cooperative. Once in a while there'd be one like the U.S. government go and try to take over somebody else's land, and of course they'd battle them. But now the U.S. government goes around and says democracy, you're a democracy, and they create these puppet communist governments, and then they go and take them over and say, see, these guys are bad guys. It's all a manipulation. That's what the pharmaceutical and medical industry are getting you to think by thinking immune system. You always have to be in defense. Your body always has to be in counter-reaction to all the poisons that go in the body. So it's not really an immune system. If you get to thinking that way, you're going to be led off into wrong thinking. My body isn't working, it's attacking itself. It's immune system is bad. Once they hook you on that, you're lost. Because you'll do nothing but attack your body. 

Q: So there's no disease where they say like autoimmune?

A: Well the body is attacking itself. It's like they say Hashimoto's, attacking the thyroid. You've got toxic iodine, you get iodized salt, goes into the thyroid. And what does it do? It starts dissolving your thyroid. Oh that's an autoimmune disease. No it isn't. It's iodized salt.

Q: And you guys, you know those pills?

Q: Oh we took iodine from our doctors. Did you ever take iodine?

A: And remember I told when I saw everybody the next year, I said who the hell's got everybody taking iodine? You know, any kind of mineral in any form except in food is rock. We don't eat rock, it's going to store in the body. And your body can't process iodine. Iodine is a rare mineral. It's only mined on three places on the planet. Three places on the planet where it's mined. It is rare. And they get you thinking your body needs all this iodine. They've got all these smoke screens to get you thinking that you need these things to buy to be well. And it's all a crap. You're just going to get sicker and sicker. And that's what they want because you keep going back and trying more things and more things. People taking vitamin supplements. You know, 50, 80, 60, 90, 100 a day. And for this magic bullet promise. And what are all those supplements made with? Kerosene or gasoline. If it's coming from a food, they have to dissolve that food. They have to dissolve the pancreas of the pig. If you've got an ear of corn, same thing with standard process. Oh, it all comes from our food. We grow it, it's organic. Well, I said at a Chicago workshop, and there were two top sales people from standard process in the audience. And I said, you know, even standard process, I told them. I got a call on Monday morning from a law firm saying, we represent standard process. You need to put a retraction in five major newspapers in the front section of every, it was about 500 grand they were demanding, to put these ads in retracting that their food was contaminated with stuff. So I got back to the, I was still in Chicago at the time, I got back a few days later, and I called the attorney and I said, I got this message from you. I'll tell you what. You go to your laboratory who's making your supplements and you find out how they take your corn, how they take your alfalfa, your parsley, and dissolve it down to extract the nutrients you're getting out of it to encapsulate or make it into pill form and sell. And I said, you tell me that that isn't kerosene or gasoline. And you tell me the process that they use. Because it's got to be new because I haven't heard about it. And I talked with a head technician that runs a major laboratory in the United States that's on my diet. And he said there's still only two things that they use, kerosene and gasoline. I said, you go find that out. You bring me a letter. You bring me the good documentation. I will borrow $500,000 and put those ads in. Never got a call back. Because that's it. There are only two products. So they have been steeping in kerosene or gasoline for a minimum of 72 hours. Would you take your food, dissolve it in kerosene for 72 hours, wash it, rinse it for two minutes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They don't. It's in it. That's what I'm saying. So people who are getting high on supplements are getting high on the toxicity created by the gasoline or hexane. I mean gasoline or kerosene that's in their blood, in their system. The adrenaline rush that the body uses adrenaline and other hormones, and that increases hormonal activity because hormones are 80 to 90, I mean 60 to 80% fat. The body uses fat to harness toxins. So all of a sudden the body is flushing out all these hormones, which are supposed to be for emergency purposes only, and this is an emergency. So these people get high on these hormones caused by the poisoning of the kerosene and gasoline.

Q: So you say most of those supplements...

A: Not most, every one of them.

Q: Even like fish oil and that?

A: Oh, the fish oil depends. It depends. If it was made by standard, I mean by green pastures, and it's fermented, there's no chemicals in it. It's fermentation process. Anything else has used chemicals. And if you're using the green pastures variety, if it's flavored, you get the same thing in the flavorings that are put in there. So the only way you can get the good cod liver oil has to be nasty tasting and burn your throat. And stink.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: I asked you, I got problems.

Q: I'm going to embarrass myself here. But I used to take $300 to $400 a month of [unintelligible] Dr. Wallace products for several years and then found out it was all toxic. My navel is oozing stuff. And I mentioned that to him.

Q: Wow.

Q: [unintelligible] what it is.

A: I'd have to look at it to see which toxin was coming out. But any time you have anything coming out of the skin, it's industrial toxin. It's damaged tissue. So you may have, you know, human cell tissue involved, but it's always those chemicals which have damaged it. And if you're using a virus, you know, a solvent to remove the [unintelligible], you're going to have oozing all over the place.

Q: What's your thought on Garden of Life, where they make it only from raw vegetables? It's the only vitamin I take, but I don't know if it's...

A: How are you going to get it into a concentrated substance?

Q: I don't know how they do it. It could be the same.

A: It is the same. There are only two things that they do it. And if they press, let's say they take the vegetable and they press it, they grind it or ferment it, and then juice it and then dry it. Once it's dried, there's no bioactive enzymes. There are no bacteria, active bioactivity. So if you have no bacteria generating the enzymes, no enzymes to digest and utilize your vitamins and supplements, you're just taking...

Q: So just get your vitamins from the vegetables?

A: Juice, vegetable juice.

Q: So what was that fish oil?

Q: Green pastures.

A: Green pastures. They're called blue ice.

Q: Yeah.

A: And it has to be the non-flavored. 

Q: And it does taste nasty.

A: And it's nasty.

Q: It's not that bad.

A: Well, now you need it so badly... I find that people that need something, even rotten meat. Rotten meat, they say, oh, [unintelligible] not so bad. It's good.

Q: If you're desperate, you will do that.

A: Yes. When the body knows that that what it needs, yeah.

Q: Well, and when you're hurt so bad, you'll do about anything.

A: Yeah, I know. I've been there.

Q: I know.

A: I was going to drown myself in a hot bath and discovered it healed my body instead of killing it. Eating raw meat, I did it to kill myself. And so I wouldn't have to fast so long to death. Look what it did. You know, I'm here working on my 67th year. And I was supposed to be dead at 21. And I only sleep three or four hours a day. And I'm constantly going.

Q: Do you juice and eat raw meats? Basically, do you juice vegetables and eat raw meats?

A: Yeah, but not together. I'll never eat vegetable juices with raw meat.

Q: Right, separately.

A: Yeah, because one's alkaline, one's acid.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: How long do you do it?

A: That's all in my books. If anything is in the books, I'm not going to go into it. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible] raw meat. There's no way I can do it.

A: Do you know how many people have said that?

Q: I know.

Q: Yeah, yeah. How about somebody like me?

Q: I don't even mind the raw [unintelligible].

A: But the raw is the whole difference.

Q: Yeah.

Q: Aajonus, all my life, up until I heard your lecture about a year ago, I always preached to my family, you cook your meat, you do this, you do that. I listened to a one-hour lecture from Aajonus. Changed my mind. Went to raw meat. Digests so easily.

A: Oh, incredibly. Changes everything.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: You can't tell the difference. You can't tell the difference.

Q: If you were sick enough.

Q: Yeah. It's all psychological.

Q: It is.

Q: It's all in the brain. Because it's a, you know, it tastes like, the meat tastes like steak.

Q: Yeah. And I don't like steak.

Q: Okay, but that's why, because it's cooked.

Q: I don't, I've never liked steak.

A: Well, maybe you're a fish or a chicken person.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, that's up to you. That's fine. Everybody has their own. Okay, now we're going to go around the room for a while. Do you have a question?

Q: I've got a couple of them. What is the ratio that you would do with bath? Say, you live in the city and you have city water with chlorine. Vinegar, milk, salt, is there, does that help neutralize?

A: Yes, it does. It depends on if you have fluoride in your water.

Q: Which one do you have?

A: If your water's really slimy, you've got a lot of fluoride in it. If it's not slimy, you've got a low concentrate of fluoride. Fluoride is one of the worst. If your water's slimy, then you need about two cups of milk to a large bath. If you have, let's say, a 50-gallon bathtub, which is the old clawfoot, you need two cups of milk. If you've got like a 30-gallon bathtub, one cup of milk would do fine.

Q: That would neutralize the fluoride.

A: Yeah. And, well, also we've got the other ingredients. That alone won't do it. Two to three tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar. And then either sea salt or Epsom salt, two tablespoons.

Q: So I can do apple cider and the milk and that's good?

A: Yeah.

Q: I don't want that salt.

A: Well, if you're having a minimal amount, three tablespoons, you can use clay.

Q: I use clay all the time.

A: Yeah, you can use clay. Okay. It makes the bathtub messier, but that's okay.

Q: I don't mind that.

A: No problem.

Q: Half a cup?

A: Oh, no, no, just three tablespoons of clay.

Q: [unintelligible] pretty bad.

A: That's really nice if you do that. But if you're going to do that, there's a spa in Nha Trang, Vietnam, where you can go there and they take big fire hoses and you get into these either two-person wooden hot tubs or you get into one of these big concrete ones, the whole family, and they pump hot clay into you and you get to stay in there for 20 minutes. Hot clay, just coat yourself with it. I mean, you're down to here, [unintelligible].

Q: Wow.

A: You know, just coat yourself. And then you get out and you get into the hot, you shower and then you get into hot springs, hot waterfalls, hot swimming pools, you know, everything. Nothing is contaminated. It is phenomenal. So if you like heavy clay, that's the place to go.

Q: Where's that at?

A: Take a trip there, Nha Trang. N-H-A-T-R-A-N-G. And it's not obvious. You have to say, where's that spa about 20 minutes away back in the mountains?

Q: What country?

A: Vietnam. It's about eight hours north by bus, if the bus doesn't break down. Eight hours north of Ho Chi Minh City, Saigon. I went on a bus and it broke down and I was there for 16 hours to get to Nha Trang. But just a one hour flight from Saigon.

Q: So the clay helps remove that stuff too?

A: Oh yeah, it's wonderful, fabulous. 

Q: So should I cut back on my clay then or is it helpful to put a half cup in?

A: Yeah, but it's expensive, but that's up to you. Very expensive.

Q: Another question I had was I heard something the other day about the weather patterns are starting to bring all the chemicals and uranium from wars and things going on. What can you do to protect yourself?

A: Well, it's not really, the winds aren't blowing this way from Afghanistan and Iraq and all those places where the wars are going on. They're contaminated, the last report I read is 1,800 times the level of radiation they're supposed to be. And the deformities in the children and miscarriages are something like 30 out of 100 deformities and miscarriages. So it's that bad there. Where we're getting it is from Fukushima. Now in March of 2011, every tuna that was caught had all of the isotopes from Fukushima. So I don't eat any food from the Pacific Ocean unless it's Baja all the way down to Chile, and nothing unless it's up in Alaska. And that's even debatable now.

Q: I eat Ecuador tuna.

A: Yeah, good. Yeah, Ecuador's fine. Anything in the Gulf, all the way down to Brazil, nothing up to, you know, Northern Carolina. Anything from North Carolina up was okay. Nova Scotia, New England, any fish around there. Anything from the Gulf, that's contaminated with a corexit. You know, that was the king and queen of England. [unintelligible] BP oil, oil spilled, and they used corexit in there to dissolve it. The corexit causes bleeding from every orifice. You know, all the fishermen that were out there using it and helping. Bleeding out the eyes, the nose, the penis, the vagina, you know, the anus. Everywhere, even bleeding out the fingernails. It has killed over three million people, and they just keep it hushed. There are only a few doctors who are working with these people on a daily basis, and they are being banned from posting and stuff like that. Threatened heavily. But once in a while, somebody will get their information and post it. I used to be in contact with them, but now all the lines, their phones are tapped and interfered with. You can just send a signal, and you can't reach them. You just can't reach them, you can't communicate. They are not allowed to communicate with the world. It's that bad. It's the king and queen of England, because they own 80% of BP, British Petroleum. Again, it's all their plight to get back at us and subjugate us. Did that answer your question or not? Do you have a question?

Q: I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on the iodine, because I'm taking a little bit of that now.

A: And what do you think it's going to do for you? Why are you taking it?

Q: Well, I'm working with a naturopath.

A: Obviously it's not a naturopath, because iodine is not natural. It's not mined at all in this country. It's mined in China and South America. How can that be natural? So you have to get out of those twisted concepts. He's not a naturopath if he's using rock, chemical rock. What do they use iodine for? What did you use as a child? You put it on a cut, right? It's a poison. It's an antiseptic. It's a poison. Just like mercury, they use mercurochrome and methylate, or liquid mercury. Those are not good. Those are not healthy. Why would a naturopath have you eating something poisonous? You have to get out of that concept altogether. A true naturopath is one that works with nature. Animals eat food. Vegetation eats rock, soil. So why would you be eating rock if you're not a plant?

Q: So it's not good to put on your skin, even?

A: Oh, it's poisonous.

Q: You have an infection.

A: It's poisonous. The bacteria helps you. If you want to limit the white blood cells that the body takes out of the bloodstream to eat the dead cells that are damaged by foreign matter, take lime juice and put it on. Stop it like that. It coats and surrounds anything. That's it. Easy. Lime juice. Not lemon. Lemon's a bacterial agent. It incites bacteria. That's why it's good for marinating. But lime juice stops it. 

Q: The iodine can cause headaches and [unintelligible]. 

A: It'll melt you. It's destroying you. Dissolving your body. As Anna said, killing your bacteria. All the processes. It's like taking an antibiotic. It is taking an antibiotic. 

Q: I'm also having a lot of brain fog. That's probably a pretty general question. [unintelligible].

A: So iodine isn't going to help that. It'll destroy the bacteria in the brain that fires the synapse. So your synapse is not going to work. You want to get your brain working, you suck eggs. Drink eggs. The way I tell everybody in the morning, eat your cheese. Absorb the poison. A tablespoon and a half to three tablespoons of cheese. Depending on how toxic your stomach and intestines are. And I can tell that by doing the irises. So I tell you how much cheese to eat the first thing in the morning. Next thing after that is downing an egg. Downing another egg ten minutes later. Ten minutes after that, another egg. Ten minutes after that, another egg. Minimum of three eggs. If you're a bigger guy, then have four eggs or five eggs. I tell you to have four or five eggs.

Q: You told me two eggs two years ago.

A: Now I'm upping it.

Q: Eggs would do what to your body?

A: Eggs stimulate... Well, the body makes glycogen, likes to make glycogen for the whole day in the first six hours of your day. If the glycogen is made from a carbohydrate, the glycogen is very sticky. So when it gets into the blood and neurological fluid, it limits brain activity because the synapses of the fire will skid. It's too sticky. You know, it's like if you're in water, you're going to move pretty good. You're in sugar, you know, it's thick like when you cook it for icing. You try to move in that, you're not going to move like you are in water. So if the body makes the glycogen from a pyruvate, which is a protein sugar, then there's no stickiness in it. So the egg white is all egg protein. So the body can make a phenomenal amount of this glycogen, non-sticky glycogen. Plus the egg yolk contains every vitamin, mineral, nutrient in the world. Only food, eggs are the only food that contains everything. So you have all that going into the brain with the glycogen. So it makes the brain really sharp. Kids who have a lot of trouble in school, in the last two years I've told them if you're going in for a test, go in the bathroom if you're embarrassed, suck a few eggs, go back into the classroom. At least one egg. They're all getting Bs and As now. Kids that were getting Bs and Cs and Ds. Every one of them is getting an A. Go in the toilet and suck an egg.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Only raw eggs.

A: Only raw eggs will do that.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: I don't suck them all the time [unintelligible].

[unintelligible]

A: It's not easy. If you start the first of the day, you have the cheese and the first of the day, that's when your body builds the glycogen.

Q: Can you put it in something else besides just raw eggs?

A: Once you... Eggs digest in 27 minutes when they're alone. When you put it with other food, it takes almost as long to digest with the other food you mix it with. Milk is the next quickest thing to digest, and that takes 6 to 10 hours. Meats take 19 to 24 hours. So, meats, raw meats.

Q: So you have to do that raw?

A: Yeah, you have them by themselves raw. It depends on what you want.

Q: You get used to it.

Q: Well, I don't know, but see, I might be just bringing it back out.

Q: No, no, you just gotta...

A: Well, you just don't. You do it like I do it. I sip a little of the egg white at a time, so it's just like slimy salt water. It's like going into the ocean and getting salty water in your mouth. And it's tasteless. Egg white is tasteless. But my throat never developed because I was given too many tetanus shots before the age of 18 months and turned me autistic. So my throat never opened and developed properly. So if I try to drink a whole egg at a time, I will bring it right back up. So I sip it, you know, and take it down. Other people do like Rocky. I mean, what Sylvester Stallone did in that movie, he did it in real life. He used to come into the health food store I worked in and I knew his wife very well. And, yeah, he'd suck down five eggs at a time, many times a day.

Q: Do they have to be organic, then?

A: Yes.

Q: They taste nasty, too.

Q: Yeah, the ones that aren't organic, yeah.

Q: So every 10 minutes, [unintelligible] wake up and...

A: Wait 10 minutes in between each one. Well, after the third egg, you know, it doesn't matter much. Five, seven minutes. And after the third egg...

Q: Is there anything else you recommend for brain fog?

A: No, whenever I have brain fog, I just suck another egg. Like, when I do my workshops, they have to make me take a break. So I will go 10 hours without stopping, but all of a sudden, I'll get... I'll lose a word, suck an egg, and 10 seconds later, I have it. But my body's used to it. I've been doing this a long time. It used to take me, you know, like 5 minutes before my brain would get active again. And I'd have that word in a split second. Then it was 3 minutes, and then it was 1 minute, and now it's like seconds. Suck an egg, and I'm right back. So my body's responding quickly.

Q: So it's the [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah. It's the glycogen. Good, clean glycogen. You make it from carrot juice, or fruits, or the worst, is a starch. Grains, cereals, and that's what people are eating.

Q: Every morning.

A: Every morning, and their brain just gets thick.

Q: Even oatmeal?

A: Even oatmeal, it's thick. You make thick brain fluid, and nervous system fluid. So that's why I have everybody eat the cheese first, to absorb the poisons in the stomach and intestines, then eat the eggs. Then, depending upon toxicity, if they're highly toxic, and good amount of weight on them, a vegetable juice, and after that a meat meal. And then just continue through the day. You know, what I recommended in the book, recipe book. And over the last few years, I've got some people to do it here, I've been using cheese a lot. Raw, no salt cheese. Eating like a sugar cube anywhere from every 15 to 60 minutes. The results of that, and again in St. Louis, the people who did that, they were cleaning their intestines, pulling poisons out of their intestinal walls and stomach. Would normally take 6 to 8 years to do it, they were doing it in one year. I mean some it was 3 years, but from 3 years to 8, 6 years. Pardon?

Q: Just the raw cheese.

A: Well just a little bit every few minutes, you know.

Q: It's hard to find raw cheese without salt in it.

Q: Oh no it's not.

Q: You know, small units.

Q: Yeah. 6 bucks a pound out there in [unintelligible].

A: If you eat salt with your cheese, you're going to re-digest your poisons. Salt is just like cooking, it explodes it.

Q: I've never been able to find raw cheese without salt.

Q: You have to have it shipped, you know.

A: You didn't get my, you got a consult with me?

Q: No.

A: Oh, that's it. When you get a consult with me, you get a product list. Or you go on wewant2live.com and buy the @[product list](primal-diet-raw-food-list). And then you can order it and have it shipped to you.

Q: Do you send newsletters out every month? Your newsletters?

A: Newsletters are supposed to be every two months. But I'm behind since January. I have five of them.

Q: I know, I paid for that.

A: I have five of them in the works, so you're going to get one every two weeks for a while.

Q: I just want to make sure I'm going to get it.

A: I just, with all these lawsuits and these court proceedings, you know, it's been hectic.

Q: Could you explain that glycogen one more time? [unintelligible] the glycogen?

A: Body has to make a fuel for the brain and nervous system, and it's called glycogen. It can be made from two things. It's a carbohydrate. I mean, it's a sugar form, but if it's made from a carbohydrate sugar, it gets very sticky and thick. Wherever that goes into the brain and nervous system, it's very thick and sticky. So things don't work so well. If the body makes it from a pyruvate, which is a protein sugar, there's no stickiness to it. And the egg white is the best thing for that. 

Q: And on your diet, you're making some other things as well.

A: Yeah, well, I'm saying don't eat any high carbohydrate in that first six hours of the day. Don't have your fruit until noon or later. 

Q: Only vegetable juice.

A: You can have the carrot juice in the vegetable juice, but you've got celery in it. Celery is a negative in carbohydrate. There's not enough carbohydrate in celery to digest celery. Even in an herbivore, an animal that normally eats a carbohydrate, vegetation. So, that's a negative. So, that'll counterbalance the over-carbohydrate in the carrot juice. And, you know, you're having a... you're not having a great deal of the carrot juice. You're having... most I've ever given is one that's 40% carrot juice. And that's somebody who has a tremendous amount of bile all over in their system and they're jaundiced. So, it's specific people mostly. It's anywhere from 20 to 30% carrot.

Q: Is that what causes gluten intolerance in a lot of people?

A: No. Gluten is from wheat. But anybody can get any kind of a sugar toxicity when it builds up. And their body doesn't handle it. It starts storing and multiplying in their system. Then that next one will be the one that does all the damage, seems to do all the damage. It's just an overload. Then after that, you've got an allergy to it just a little bit. It's going to trigger a reaction from the body from having too much. That's what an allergy is. You have too much of something in your system and you haven't been able to get rid of it. And anymore, it's going to cause some irritation in the system which can cause degeneration of tissue. So you have an allergy [unintelligible] vomit, diarrhea, sneezing. Some way your body is going to say, don't eat that. 

Q: What if you ate something you didn't know you had an allergy to?

A: If you've had processed foods, canned packaged foods...

Q: I'm talking about shellfish.

A: Pardon?

Q: Shellfish.

A: That's what we put in a lot of foods. We put in a lot of foods that are manufactured. So you've got a lot of waste products from the fish industry. These food companies will buy that substance. There's a chemical, they'll dissolve it in kerosene or gasoline. And then put it... 

[audio cut]

A: ...Chemical process.

Q: Oh, I'm definitely allergic to shellfish. [unintelligible] A couple times a night. Severe reactions right away.

A: Then you've had something...

Q: Puking, pooping. Vomiting and [unintelligible], the whole thing.

A: They put a lot of that in baby food.

Q: Oh, really?

A: Yeah. A lot of that in baby food. Because it's mush already.

Q: [unintelligible] enriched.

Q: After eating the cheese, do you do that first thing in the morning? And then how long do you wait before you eat the eggs?

A: Ten minutes.

Q: Oh, ten minutes.

A: Yeah, ten minutes. And you should always eat cheese ten minutes before you eat anything else, so you don't have those toxins dumping from the stomach and intestines into your food, so it'll go through and clean it up ahead of you. And if you're eating meat, it takes so long to digest, grate a little bit of cheese with your meat meals.

Q: I'd like to ask why Reagan got sick. He had access to everything.

A: Pardon?

Q: You said that Reagan had his own food and...

A: Well, Reagan still bought the crap. I mean, he got injections, he got doctors. You know, he got shot in the heart. 

Q: Yeah.

A: Actually, he got shot in the heart and lived. You know, I don't like the guy, but boy, that was... You know, you could tell he was eating the right foods from his ranch, his own beef. And he ate all of it rare. I mean, it was singed on both sides. He was a pretty strong guy until they shot him. Then when they shot him, all the chemicals that went into him during that surgery caused him to develop palsy. So that's when all that started, within months after that. But they heavily... They put antibiotics in him. They put him out and they did anything to him that they wanted to. Maybe it wasn't his choice to do it had he been, you know, awake. Yeah, they really contaminated him. They took his whole breastplate open, take the bullet out. It was like open-heart surgery. Not like it, it was open-heart surgery. And they had to mend the heart. And then they coated him with iodine and mercury. Mercurochrome all inside. Poison. So all that went up into his brain. All of a sudden he had palsy. 

Q: Two years later he had Alzheimer's. 

A: Yeah. Mercury causes Alzheimer's. If you go online and you put Alberta University Mercury Neurons YouTube, you'll come up with a video that shows you how the mercury causes lesions in the brain exactly as they appear in Alzheimer's. And lead doesn't do it, aluminum. None of those other things do it. Only the mercury. So mercury causes Alzheimer's.

Q: They used to say aluminum.

A: Well, aluminum can cause misfiring of the brain, you know, synapse. And congest the ganglia and axions. But it's the mercury that dissolves and causes the lesions where no information can get through.

Q: It's good to be [unintelligible].

A: Do you have a question?

Q: I have three. The first would be like the eye fog. Like when you have just the frontal part of the eye is losing its visual clarity. 

A: Is that because the cornea is warped or because you're actually getting a fog?

Q: It's called presbyopia. It's what the ophthalmologist said. Just, you know, getting older.

A: No, that's the warping of the cornea.

Q: So a 20-20 vision, but it's just not, you can't see it close like I used to.

A: That's warping of the, myopia is a warping of the cornea. Egg white, butter some people use.

Q: Just put a little bit of that in the corners of your eyes.

A: Yeah. Well, what I ask people to do is, you know, you used to take an eye cup and then you got this all over the place, you know. Eye droppers still got it all over the place. What I suggest you is take a, you know, break an egg into a bowl and just dip it in like that. Look up and rub it along the white of the eye. And then roll the eye around like you're a circus master. Coat the eye.

Q: Okay.

A: And if you use butter you have to do it before you go to sleep because it will take five minutes to unfold.

Q: Yeah, I know.

A: But some people's eyes will improve three times faster with butter if they use it at night than if they use egg white. So it depends on how fast you want to do it.

Q: Can you do both?

A: Yeah, if you do egg white in the morning and butter at night.

Q: How much butter?

A: Pardon?

Q: How much butter?

A: Oh, just enough, barely enough. Just a little. Not even a drop, you know, just a little dab of melted butter. You melt it in your hand, get it warm, and then just dab it and rub it on. But do it while you're already in bed.

Q: Yeah.

A: Because you'll be fogged over unless you know your house very well.

Q: Would it matter if the butter is real old?

A: Yes, it will burn more.

Q: Oh, it's going to burn more?

A: It will burn more, but still won't hurt. It'll have a sensation of burning, but it doesn't really burn. In fact, it'll help. It's bacteria that'll help eat away the excess layer of the cornea, so it'll work faster. But man, does it burn for like five, ten minutes. You need another tape?

Q: Yeah, I just got one.

A: So the older butter will eat the bacteria and do that more? No, the bacteria in the butter will eat the dead cells on the cornea, which are causing the fog and the warping of the cornea, the myopia. The myopia.

Q: Oh, it's eating it from the myopia?

A: Yes, eating the dead cells from the myopia. Well, the myopia is the warping of the cornea. Eating the bacteria from the butters, eating the dead cells in the cornea that are causing the myopia.

Q: What about, I have been diagnosed with a heart rhythm, irregular heart rhythm, not life-threatening, but...

A: Arrhythmia? Or...

Q: [unintelligible] he didn't call it that. It goes like this.You know, heart attack symptoms, that kind of thing.

A: Heart attack symptoms are not...

Q: No, I don't have heart attack symptoms. Or look, the chest. Pressure, the... Well, I was having too much stress, and anyways, it'll be brought on by stress if I get, if I'm getting myself really worked up.

A: You mean you just get a fast heartbeat or you get an irregular heartbeat?

Q: It's irregular.

A: Like, it'll drop down like 32 beats a minute.

Q: It'll, it'll go up, it'll be 120, and then bam, it'll just like drop down to 65.

A: Yeah, but that's not irregular heart, irregular heartbeats when you skip a beat.

Q: I didn't say irregular.

A: Beat fast, skip a beat, you know, [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible] I have a regular problem where it go, it'll go really, really low for just no apparent reason.

A: No, it's not no apparent reason. When you have stress, you have a lot of byproducts. You have a lot of lactic acids and other byproducts that build up. If those build up, you don't absorb oxygen, you lose energy. The heart's got to pump faster, get more oxygen into the system. So your body's doing what it should do. You just got to take hot baths to get rid of the poisons, because you're not detoxing. And of course, that's going to raise your heart level rate while you're in a hot bath.

Q: Well, like I get real tired.

A: You're not absorbing your oxygen.

Q: So we were on this heart monitor, and he was monitoring every single beat for two weeks to determine that it's just this rhythm problem.

A: Absolute bullshit.

Q: Well, I mean, he read the beats, so I'm not on the medicine.

A: It's absolute bullshit. If you don't have any energy, you're not utilizing your oxygen. Because you've got too many waste products in your blood and other areas of your body. That's the only reason you will have weakness. Unless you've been in an auto accident and bruised every muscle in your body. Or broken a leg. Your body's going to use all the nutrients for that damaged area. Then you're going to be weak, you're going to be bedridden until the body's finished concentrating its nutrients in a particular area. A lot of people who are sick don't have any energy because the body's using all those nutrients to try to resolve the health issues. So they need to eat and sleep, eat and sleep like a baby.

Q: Yeah, you can't though. [unintelligible]

Q: You do, you utilize your time very well.

Q: Last one, what about the hot yoga, going back to when you were talking about heat and saunas?

A: What is the highest the body temperature gets during exercise? 100.1, very high. Most people stick around 99 something. Normally you're supposed to be 98.6. You're only going to go up one degree, really, only one degree. And when you're working your hardest and you're perspiring. In order to melt those plastic oils out of the body, it has to be 105 degrees. So you can exercise all you want. Let's say you've got a jar, a two cup jar, and you've got a cold stick of butter in the center. And you get on a trampoline or you do Bikram yoga and you've got that thing strapped to you. How long is it going to take the air space around that cold stick of butter that's going to be broadcasting cold? Your body is going to be broadcasting the heat and the room is going to be broadcasting... How long is it going to take before your movement causes that to even melt? 90 minutes.

Q: If I'm in that hot room, isn't there a benefit to sweating all that out?

A: Remember, if you've got beads of plastic blocking the larger substances that need to come through and they're getting blocked and collecting underneath, you can perspire all the liquid you want, all the water you want, you're not going to get rid of your poisons.

Q: Does it bring them out of the lymphatic system at least?

A: Your lymphatic system dumps its waste under the skin and then the connective tissue will be perspired.

Q: And that can come out in the bath.

A: Yeah, exactly. That's what I tried to get you to do it a long time ago.

Q: The water won't stay hot long enough. I'm going to run out of water in my hot water heater, so I'm boiling a stockpot of soup.

A: Well, turn that thing up all the way.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Then it's old and what you need to do is take a coat hanger, a very strong, tight metal coat hanger, go in there and break up all that crusty plaque at the bottom or get a new water heater. And drain that thing. As the minerals from your water cake in that hot water tank, when it gets this thick, your water will never heat over 120 degrees. And you need up to 140, 170.

Q: You need it that hot?

A: Well, what I do is when I'm taking it in the bath and not a hot tub, a hot tub has a constant heater and pump. Yeah, and filter on it. In a bathtub, you have to heat the water. I'll heat it, I'll scald it. First, I'll put scalding hot water in it halfway. And I'll let it sit for 15, 5, 10 minutes. Sometimes longer. Heats the entire tub. Then I put lukewarm water in and bring that up to about, down to 112. And then I put my milk and my other ingredients in that. And I let that sit for 17... 7 minutes and then I get it in at 110 degrees. And then in 20 minutes, it'll go down to 102, depending upon the bathtub.

Q: I think that's pretty fast.

A: Not if you scald the tub first.

Q: Oh, that's a good idea.

A: That's the thing, scalding the tub first. Then it'll take 20 minutes, sometimes 25 minutes before it gets down to 102. Then you let two inches out. After the first inch, you turn on the scalding water, tunnel the cold water down the drain. You know, this is the water level here. You tunnel it here so your cold water's not going and cooling your, you know, the rest of your warm water. Because then you're going to have to add even more water to it, let more water out. So you tunnel it down. As soon as that water gets hot coming out of the spout, you cap the drain, pop the plug, whatever you want to do, flip the lever. And then you let, you swirl that hot water around until you've filled the two inches. And your water will be up to 110, 111. And you sit there for 20 more minutes, 25 minutes, and you let two inches out. So if you're in there 90 minutes, it's going to be three times.

Q: You have to do 90 minutes, huh?

A: If you want to get deep to the lymph glands and lymph nodes. If you only want to get to under the skin, like, you have a lot of that waste product under your skin. See all that? All of that is the waste. That's not muscle I'm holding. That's all your waste product, all the fluid that you're not perspiring out of the body. People will keep swelling the more it's jammed. The older they get, they just keep swelling. They didn't used to do that. You know, before hydrogenated oils came out in the 60s, people never, you know, some people bloated out because they were on candies and chips and lots of salt. But you didn't have the amount of people doing that that they do now. They have all that waste. You see me? There's no waste under there. I keep it clean.

Q: Shall we all pinch?

A: That's a lot, yeah.

Q: Should I get the camera?

Q: I love the way you speak.

Q: So it's because you're not getting it out.

A: Yeah, you're not eliminating it. It's staying in your connective tissue, under your skin and in the muscles.

Q: So how long does it take to get all that out if you're bathing like that?

A: Maybe 10 years.

Q: But you can speed it up though by what you're saying with the cheese, bring the cheese more.

A: Yeah, then you'll stop throwing all the waste out the skin. Normally, naturally, 90% of the waste is supposed to leave to the skin, not the digestive tract.  But when I figured out if you take the cheese, no salt, raw cheese, and no honey or fruit with it, it'll pull the poisons out and you're evacuating all your poisons with 96% of the cheese.

Q: You're just eating it.

A: You're just eating it, it's passing through you, taking out the toxins. So then the burden is taken off of the skin.

Q: Even the hard, hardened plastic too?

A: Hardened plastic what?

Q: Oh, the oil, the hardened plastic oil.

A: Well, not where it runs in the skin and around, only where it's in the gut. It'll pull them, if they're mineral bound, but there's always minerals bound in those oils. The body won't set them free. There'll always be something attached to them, some mineral.

Q: So you recommend how many baths a day?

A: One bath a day, 90 minutes, before you go to sleep at night. If you get a hot tub, that way you can just spend your first 90 minutes of sleep in the hot tub, then you get out and go to bed and go to sleep for the rest of the time.

Q: Do you clean those out all the time though, the chemicals, the hot tub?

A: The hot tub? No. I had a 300-pound sand filter that belongs to a swimming pool on mine. I never changed the sand once in 12 years. And then they tore the house down because we didn't get a permit for it. They were after me. There was no permit on that house. Tear it down. But you still put the stuff in there for that.

Q: You like to put your vinegar?

A: No, I had well water. If I didn't have well water, I'd put that in there. But the sand filter will clean that. I did put coconut cream a lot in there because I would clean my body with fermented coconut cream. And that water always came out crystal clear. And I only had the sand filter. It allowed the algae to grow though. And I let the algae grow. It was very thick and long.

Q: It was green.

A: Yeah. Well, the water wasn't green.

Q: No, it was on the...

A: Yeah, it was on the side.

Q: It was soft.

A: And it's so great. It's so soft. It's silky. And algae eats rock, like I said. So it pulls it out of your skin. So it will help you eliminate, you know, metals from your tissues.

Q: Let the algae grow.

A: In my swimming pool in the Philippines, there is no, any kind of toxins. I don't even have a sand filter. I just let that algae get dark and as thick as it can. And you can feel it. You can see the skin, how radiant it is. You can come out of it [unintelligible]. It's phenomenal. Okay, finished? You had your three?

Q: Yes.

A: Okay.

Q: Yeah, I do have a question. I am guilty of this iodine [unintelligible]. I have very low body temperature, or had very low body temperature, 95, 96, cold all the time. Of course, I have read Dr. [unintelligible] hypothyroidism type 2. Started adding iodine drops to the skin. It solved one problem, but probably created another one.

A: A dozen more. Low bacteria levels.

Q: Tell me, talk about hypothyroidism.

A: Hyper and hypo.

Q: I know.

A: Did you watch my DVD? Workshop DVD. There's so much information about the human body in that. Just buy the DVD. You can watch it a hundred times. It's five and a half hours of information about how the human body works. And in there I tell you that all endocrine gland activity is for emergency purposes only. Each gland has a different thing... 

[audio cut]

A: ...from those guys while they were out. It's just a tiny amount of blood. But it's enough to tell what hormones were in that. Now normally your football players are running around with adrenaline, high adrenaline, estrogen, and testosterone. That's normal. Because those are physical hormones, they're out there beating each other up. So those are normally high. But what happened in the situation when you have the lungs and the heart stop, thyroxin skyrockets every minute. Skyrockets. And then it's like an electrical shock. The lungs and the heart start instantly. They don't... And two guys that were taken off the field to the hospital, they didn't create that thyroxin. Their thyroxin stayed low. Then it doubled in five minutes. But it wasn't high enough to kick the heart and the lungs back in like it did when those other guys that popped out of it on the field in three, five minutes. Three, four minutes. Five minutes they took them off the field.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Thyroids weren't working properly. Probably a lot of, maybe a lot of iodine they took and poisoned the thyroid. Many reasons for that. Unless you fall out of a tree or get in a football game and knock the wind out of yourself and your heart stops, you don't need thyroxine. This whole crap that it affects your weight and your hair, that's all... The pharmaceutical house knows how vain people are. Men and women. And you tell them it's going to prevent their hair from falling out? They're going to take thyroxine. And how many people are losing their hair because of vaccines and poison? Chemical poisons. Everybody. Absolutely everybody. So how many people are going to run out there and take thyroxine when they don't need it? When it doesn't affect, it doesn't have anything to do with hair loss or weight gain? It's all a spin to get you to buy, buy, buy, buy, buy. And not get better.

Q: And I was on the Gerson diet, which they tell you to put iodine in your juices.

A: Okay, you weren't on the Gerson diet. You were on the daughter's diet.

Q: Charlotte's.

A: Charlotte's diet.

Q: Okay. 

A: His diet was nothing like hers. She thinks she's smarter than her father. Let me tell you, when she started taking the raw liver out of the diet, the rate of cancer reversal is around 22%. When her father ran it, the reversal rate was like 62%.

Q: Well, and they don't even have the liver anymore.

A: I know, that's what I'm saying.

Q: The shot. No, the shot even. They can't even get that anymore. So, but I was, that's what she did. And so I did do that, and I know that caused the problem. And so, but my thyroid seems to pull. I, like, I took a bath today, and it would just, when my heart starts pounding, it starts to pull. I can start feeling it. And then I can't have something real close to my neck. It's just, it's a ball, it's like I can't have anything around my neck.

A: You put a hot water bottle around there at night and help perspire that stuff out of your neck. Get those lymph glands going to clean that thyroid.

Q: Okay.

A: What do you think of Jolie?

Q: Who?

Q: Stupid.

A: Angelina Jolie cutting off her breasts.

Q: What?

Q: She's stupid.

A: She cut off her breasts.

Q: What for?

A: To prevent breast cancer.

Q: Did she really do that?

A: No, she really did it. No, it was done.

Q: I didn't know if it was a...

A: No, it was done. She did it.

Q: She's not the only woman that's done that.

A: Oh yeah, but I mean this is a famous woman that's supposed to be smarter than that. She was told she had the gene that there was an 86% chance of her getting breast cancer. Absolute nonsense.

Q: Yeah, I know.

A: Absolute nonsense, but she bought it and chopped off her breasts. Now, think about that. You've got 11 major lymph glands on your breasts. Lymph glands are responsible for cleaning the lungs. Those in here and here. So, if she's not going to get breast cancer now, what's she going to get? 

Q: Lung cancer.

A: Lung cancer.

Q: Oh my goodness.

A: Yep.

Q: Because they tell people that. I mean, I know they, you know, I have friends that they've told that, you know, that they have that gene or whatever.

A: And it's bullshit. It's absolute bullshit.

Q: Absolute nonsense.

A: It's horrible.

Q: It's bullshit.

A: She's got, she has 22 less lymph glands to take care of toxicity out of her lungs.

Q: I love it when they say they're full of cancer and they'll take them out. You're like, well, they're great, they're doing their job.

A: Yes, exactly. It's insane.

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay, do you have another question? If you come up with one, let me know.

Q: The only other question is, raw meat sources, I've been buying it from Whole Foods, but I've been told that their raw meat, grass-fed raw meat, maybe isn't really grass-fed. Grass-fed for the last 10 days of their life. Any knowledge, any information on that?

A: If it tastes like really gamey meat, it's grass-fed. If it doesn't, if it tastes like normal meat, it is not grass-fed. Gamey meats, grass-fed meats are not very nice tasting. They're very gamey.

Q: What's your thought on frozen, if the meat's been frozen, if it's grass-fed? It's very hard to find fresh raw.

A: Well, you have to find somebody who will sell it to you unfrozen. In my animal test in the late 80s, I took one group of animals and fed them the same meat, frozen. I had a side of beef, half of a beef, and I split it and fed one and froze one of them for 10 days. And I fed that one group, frozen, from the same meat, from the same animal. Fed the other group, non-frozen. Got a little stinky. Oh, that's okay, but I needed to refrigerate it. All the animals that had it frozen got skin disease within six weeks. And I mean, one of them had, like, the mange. Those that had it unfrozen didn't drink much water. Those gobbled down the water, and they all had skin disease. That's, you know, there are a lot of toxins produced by freezing your meats. It could create heterocyclic amines, lipid peroxides, all kinds of problems. What it is, I didn't test for it because that would have been about $80,000 to test chemically for it. I was interested in the results. So then I knew that raw butter will heal any skin disorder, no matter what it is. So I took butter from the same batch, froze for 10 days some, and began giving it to them. And that group, split that group in two, and gave unfrozen and frozen raw butter to those animals. The ones that got the frozen butter took five times longer to heal their skin disorder. So if I break that down statistically, that means it destroys 80% of the healing nutrients in the butter. In the meat, it actually made it toxic. And I've watched people feed their animals frozen meat. And I've watched them get skin disorders. It takes longer because I'm giving them raw butter and they're giving them raw eggs. So if they think, oh, it's just an animal, I'll just feed them, you know, regular meats, frozen meats from the store. But there's a repercussion for it.

Q: Yeah, I try not to buy raw meat [unintelligible]. It's very hard to find fresh. [unintelligible]

A: Well, you know, I've been buying whole foods, you know, meats intermittently. It's nasty tasting, so for me, it's, you know, I believe it's grass-fed for their lives.

Q: I heard the Bushes were connected with Whole Foods.

A: The Bushes own the Whole Foods, through trust, the Bass family and the Bush family. That's why it's a racket, a scam.

Q: Whole Foods is a scam?

A: Whole Foods is a scam. They say, go, go, go organic. They carry about 2% really organic foods in there. And 90% of their products have GMO substances in it. Pardon?

Q: They won't label them.

A: Nope. 98% of their products contain GMO products.

Q: That's crazy.

Q: 98%?

A: Excuse me, 90% of all the products they have, packaged products, in their stores.

Q: Oh, they're packaged products.

A: Yes.

Q: No, they're produce.

Q: Produce.

A: Well, the corn could be GMO, you know, any of the fresh stuff.

Q: Yeah, there's one [unintelligible].

A: There's very little organic produce in there. There's like 2% of it.

Q: Yeah.

Q: Okay.

Q: One guy in the meat department at the Whole Foods here will say, there's nothing organic in this country.

Q: Yeah.

Q: Because as far as the crossing over of the GMOs, you probably can't...

A: Not on your regular markets.

Q: Yeah.

A: But if you have your own farmers...

Q: Right, right, right. 

A: I get everything directly from the farm.

Q: Right. In the store.

Q: But what if you can't? You can't do that. If you don't have farmers, you can't have that.

A: You can do that. I make connections with farmers. I made a connection with over 100 farmers. And 60 are under my umbrella. And they supply all of my patients and many others.

Q: Go Vernon.

A: Yeah, Vernon's still doing it now.

Q: Yay.

Q: I think I'm going to call up for that sentencing. If anybody wants to write up anything.

Q: What is it?

Q: For what?

Q: For the sentencing.

Q: [unintelligible] court for the milk.

Q: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

A: And we won all the important battles because we broke the seal. But that's going to be very, you know... They're probably going to, you know, want to punish us. You know, so they might send some into jail. But, and Vernon just told me this morning. You know, I talk with Vernon regularly. He said, I don't want you to sue the judge. And I said, wait a minute. You do your crusade thing. Don't get in my way of my crusade thing. Because I'm going to sue the state. As soon as this is all over, your court stuff is finished. Your sentence, whatever it is, or you're absolved. I'm suing the state for destroying 2,200 pounds of my milk. Putting a dye in it. That was my milk. I have a contract for it. I'm going to sue them. And I'm going to sue everybody else involved. In the whole thing. And I'm not going to let them get away with it. Because they'll just keep doing it. They're going to pay me 10 times what that milk was worth. And I'll give it to Vernon to help rebuild that burned down barn.

Q: They burned his barn down?

A: They burned his barn down. You better believe they burned his barn down. They burned one of his barns down. They destroyed all of his chickens. And all of his new tractors. All of his new tractors. They're just trying to destroy us. Let me tell you, they're out to do us in. They don't want us to win.

Q: There's power.

Q: There is.

A: Governmental people and business people are ruthless. Mercenaries. Questions?

Q: Yeast. I know you like that.

A: What yeast? You're talking about yeast inside your vagina?

Q: Yes.

A: Yeast in your throat?

Q: Exiting the vagina. I have friends, you know, when it's coming out the skin.

A: And what did I talk about before? The fungus is a yeast. All yeasts are fungus.

Q: Right.

A: You have cleansing fungus. When you've got things so toxic that bacteria and parasites can't be your janitors, you have fungus. And when that's too toxic, then you have virus. And remember the waste products of those fungal janitors is 15 times what it is from the bacteria. It causes all the itching and damage. You've got to take hot baths. You've got to sleep with hot water bottles to get it out of your body. Quickly so it doesn't hang up in the skin. Because it will rip the fats out of your cells. That dries the cells, causes the itching. 

Q: So I've dealt with that, talk about an embarrassing thing, for probably my whole life. As a teen, when it started. It goes back and forth, but can I see that as an okay thing?

A: That's a good thing.

Q: Okay.

A: But you just have to keep treating the skin. You're going to have to put butter, bone marrow and butter on there.

Q: You know what, I'm just kind of used to it. I mean, it's not my skin anymore. For me, it's vaginal. And so, you know what, I just deal with it. And it's just kind of one of those things that I kind of changed my perspective and say, hey, all right. It's good.

A: Yeah, absolutely.

Q: You know, because I don't dump a lot. I need to be in the bath. I don't go through these heavy dump sessions. And so, I do get a little concerned sometimes because I know I'm toxic. But I've had that my whole life and dumped heavily through that arena. So, I'm thinking, OK, is that the way my body is chosen?

A: Yes, that is the way.

Q: It's a vehicle.

A: This is the best I've seen you. Finally, you've got some weight on you.

Q: I've actually lost a little bit in doing my kickboxing lately.

A: Oh, so you're even bigger. Great.

Q: Oh, yeah.

A: Because I like weight.

Q: I know. I'm telling you. This is weight.

Q: You should have seen her two years ago when she came to me.

A: Skinny?

Q: I can barely buy clothes to fit and cover her body parts up.

A: Oh, so you were bigger.

Q: No, no, she was tiny. [unintelligible]

Q: I gained 40 pounds.

Q: Well, I think I'm over 200 pounds, so I don't know.

A: But that's good. That's good.

Q: Oh, my gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

A: No, I knew one woman who was chronically fatigued and in fibromyalgia for 13 years. She was in bad shape. And finally, she was really overweight this time. And all of her conditions and her irises had improved triple what she had done before. Body puts its toxins in fat. If you don't have that fat, they're going to go into your cells, cause more damage, cause more disease. You've got excess fat and lots of excess, the body just dumps in there. 

Q: So when she gets rid of it, will the fat go then too? The toxins go with the fat?

A: Yeah, toxins go with the fat.

Q: And it's not going, it's staying.

A: Two and a half months ago, I was this big. I was a 47 waist. I had to put my pants [unintelligible] for the first time.

Q: I do that all the time, oh my gosh. Cause I hurt there too, so.

A: But I felt the best I had since I was kidnapped and injected. With those three injections, you know, so. I just liked that fat, you know. I was eating like three quarters to a cup of cream a day. About two sticks of butter a day. So I gained it in like eight, oh seven weeks. I went from a 34 inch waist to a 47. And you know, I've gone down in the last two months. Cause I had to go to South Africa and can't get a lot there. And get the milk and some cream. But you know, not butter and not much cream. And then I had to go to Australia. And that's the same situation there. Not a lot of, everybody's getting as much as they can. But not enough. So, and then I went to Asia where I can only get milk. No butter or cream there. So, you know, I lost it again. I'm down to now about a 35. But I'm working up again. In St. Louis I started downing the cream.

Q: So what do you do then when you're in those areas?

A: I eat the same things, I just don't get as much cream and butter.

Q: Do you do lower fat?

A: No, I usually do coconut cream, lots of coconut cream. I go through probably, I take the meat of the coconut, you know, that's not completely ripe. It's about half ripe. And I'll grate it and blend it with the coconut water. And I'll drink two liters of those a day, get all that fat. And then as much meat fat as I can. And I drink two quarts of water, of milk too, a day, I don't drink any water. So I drink two quarts of milk a day. Maybe I have a cup a month, you know, a tablespoon at a time or an ounce at a time. Everything's water. Meat's 50-70% water. Milk is 86-96% water. 

Q: I always want to drink, um, first after I eat that meat.

A: Then you sip about two ounces of milk after your meat.

Q: It's not enough. It's like I want more.

A: Well, then do it over a period of time. Have an ounce, wait three minutes, have another ounce, wait three, four minutes, have another ounce. That's the way to do it. Just don't gulp.

Q: I want cold milk. I know, I know.

A: Casein and lactate will get right through the stomach into your blood without digesting. Then you're going to lose a lot of nutrients trying to police that. Can you imagine digesting those in your blood? How contaminated that can get?

Q: Just hold it in your mouth before you swallow it.

A: Yeah, before you swallow it, you can do that. But there's not much bacterial activity. I take mine in, you know, 12 to 24 hours before I drink it, like this. I never refrigerated. This is right out of the cow. And I never refrigerated. In 12 hours it was already kefir.

Q: So you don't want to have cold milk?

A: Not a good idea.

Q: I just want cold things. I just want cold.

A: Then you just take a cold pack and you put it on your cheek. You know, whatever you want that, or put it on your wrist.

Q: Yeah, my tissues feel hot. It's like I have to cool down.

A: Well, that's iodine. Iodine heats up and burns.

Q: Yeah, I thought we had that.

A: Iodine causes a lot of heat and burns.

Q: Oh my god, I feel like I'm on fire.

A: Yeah, that's iodine.

Q: All the iodine makes me feel like I'm on fire.

A: And that's a natural therapist.

Q: [unintelligible] take it out of my body.

A: Oh, it can take a long time. Raspberries, zucchini juice, zucchini pulp, strawberries, all of those will help eliminate. Cheese helps eliminate it faster.

Q: Maybe that's what's going on is I feel hot all the time. My tissues feel hot.

A: It just takes a cold pack. You know, a tiny one. Put it on you to cool you once in a while.

Q: I've gotten that way, Joan. You know, prior to the diet, I was always so cold.

Q: Yeah.

Q: And I couldn't understand how people could drink ice water or ice anything in the winter.

Q: Yeah.

Q: Well, I've totally become that person. I want the cold now. And I feel warmer also. I'm not cold like I always was.

A: Another thing you can do, the brain doesn't like to get hot. That's what makes [unintelligible] hot. So when you get into a hot tub and you get over, heat prostration, you have a bowl of cold water with ice cubes floating in and your wash rag. Just wring it just a little bit from the top of your head. Stick your hands in there up to the wrists. Fisted, but not tight-fisted, so the water gets in there. You will get cold to the bone and it will chill the skull. If the brain lowers its temperature, do that for two minutes, you will be able to stay in there easily. The body loves the heat, the brain hates it. So, you get that, you take some good drinking water, Perrier or, I mean, Gerolsteiner or any, you know, Apollinaris, any of those, and you put it in a glass container and put it in the freezer. Don't put it in plastic, don't put it in aluminum, because you're going to get those phthalates and PBAs into your ice water. So, you make, you know, you make a tray of it, dump it out, you know, eat the runs of lukewarm water over the glass pie plate, whatever you're using, knock the ice out, crack it out, and put it back in a container, put it in the freezer, and take a little piece of that and keep it in your mouth. And that's the way to counter that.

Q: I have a metal pan, so I use metal.

A: Metal, anything you freeze, anything you're going to pull substances of the container, glass you want.

Q: How do you do ice cubes though? [unintelligible] in plastic.

A: No, you can't make ice cubes, you make a whole tray of ice. You dump it out and you break it up. Like the old days, you get an ice pick or something.

Q: So you shouldn't put the ice in that metal pan. You shouldn't put the ice in the metal.

A: Like I said, it's aluminum, you're going to get aluminum in there. Tons of aluminum. If it was plastic, you're going to get tons of bisphenol phosphates and phthalates.

Q: So what are you making the ice in?

A: Something glass. Pyrex is good. Corningware is good.

Q: You shouldn't even mix stuff up in metal bowls.

A: Even stainless steel has tin in it. 

Q: I know.

A: I ran into somebody two weeks ago that actually used silverware. They had been on the diet for like seven years. Real silver. And I said, do you know what's in silver? It's 50% mercury and thallium. And that mercury and thallium is getting into you every time you use that instrument. Those utensils. Oh, but it's my silver. I said, well sell it if it's worth something. And buy good food with it. Buy wooden utensils or stainless steel. You're going to eat with it, but don't eat with silver.

Q: Should you even wear silver jewelry then?

A: Well, especially now it's not a good idea because the government allows 7% spent uranium. And in building materials they allow 22%. Because our government is getting rid of the old atomic bombs made of uranium. Because they've gone down from 70,000 nuclear weapons down to 10,000. Well, now it's 16,000 right now. And by 4 years it's supposed to get down to 10,000. So all the armed countries, Russia and all of them, have agreed to get down to 10,000 nuclear warheads. I mean, yeah, 10,000 nuclear warheads. You know what you can do with 10,000 nuclear? Well, you can destroy the world several times over. But that's from 70,000 down. The government is taking those bombs, metal of those bombs, and selling it to the steel industry. And the government says you can use 7% in jewelry and 22% in building materials. So that means your home, anything that's steel that you buy now, can be 22%. Jewelry, 7%. Spent uranium. Spent is a lie. It doesn't mean anything. It means it's been used. But the radioactive element in it is not diminished. It takes 550,000 years to diminish it.

Q: How can you even sell that?

Q: Money. The government.

A: These people are so greedy. Any way to get your money from you so they can spend your money. These are just parasites. These politicians are just parasites. Okay. Another question?

Q: You mentioned the dogs. My husband, we feed him the frozen fat. She has epilepsy. I have a big dog that has epilepsy.

A: And she's going to continue.

Q: Well, but she doesn't do bad if we feed her fat. Literal fat, cut off, whatever we get at the grocery store, but my husband will freeze it.

A: So you lose 80% of it.

Q: So we're losing 80% of it. But she's lumpier than heck. Lumpier. She has a huge...

A: Frozen fat. Can't utilize 80% of it.

Q: And the meat, I'm sure he gets... I let him take care of the dogs. I let my [unintelligible] take care of the animals. You know...

A: Well, then you get to watch them.

Q: I love them, but you know, it's like, it's an experiment. And he would throw leftover, like, apples. He had an apple [unintelligible]. He was feeding Molly apples in with her food at some point. And that thing would grow. And then he quit. And then we'd give her green strings. I mean, it's amazing.

A: Yeah, it's a great experiment. The poor dog is an experiment.

Q: Well, I mean, she's better off than what she was. We got our doctor to write off... when she got picked up by the pound and they wanted us to shoot her with all the... And we got our doctor to write off that she had epilepsy and we don't want to give her those shots. You have to give her whatever. So, we, you know, we got out of that.

A: Well, good. Your kids get to see all that, the changes. They really will understand.

Q: Yeah.

A: And you and your husband will understand. 

Q: Yeah, well, he... yeah, but he still eats the way he wants to. Because he's... you know, okay, that's a whole other topic.

A: He thinks he's Superman.

Q: He's Superman, man. And he is. I mean, he's got 20-year-old kids. They can't do half of what he does at 52 eating... But he's very choosy at the fast food restaurants. He won't get the fries. He won't eat the... I mean, you know, he does feel like he... And he burns it off, because he's working all day. So he only eats the fast food, but anyway. So I...

A: Well, those people usually last to their 50s, and then they go like that.

Q: Yeah, he's 52 and a half. So... Sweet milk.

A: Do you get any milkshakes into him? Anything?

Q: Oh, yeah.

A: Oh, okay.

Q: He makes a smoothie every night with cream and...

A: Oh, good. Get something into him.

Q: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, because I don't...

A: He'll preserve his life a little bit.

Q: I think so. I don't have it in the house. So when he leaves, he eats it, but, of course, when he comes home, then whatever. Um, sweet milk. I've been craving it for probably... Oh, it's probably been, what, six, nine months I've been downing a quart a day, at least, with a ton of honey in milk.

A: In your milk, yeah.

Q: I hated it before.

A: So?

Q: Yeah, am I healing. Is it a healing thing?

A: Yeah, well, it's... According to a Navy doctor in the 70s, he lived with the tribes in Guatemala for, I think it was... 16, 17 years. And he found that whenever they get sick, they would take a lot of honey, consume a lot of honey. And they healed five times faster than anybody else healed anything. And then he started to experiment with using the honey on troops that were stationed down there. And he found the same results. They healed five times faster.

Q: We go through the honey at my house. Sometimes the kids just want to eat it. What about craving citrus? I want an orange and a lemon, the whole peel, with my juice, in my juice. Pineapple.

A: You're not taking your baths.

Q: I know.

A: Those are signs that your body's trying to get rid of plastic, oil, and they'll never do it enough. You'd have to have a ton of it and demineralize your body. So when you eat a lot of those citrus, you're going to demineralize your bones and your teeth, everything.

Q: Pineapple too?

A: Pineapple too, that's right.

Q: I eat a lot of pineapple. I crave pineapple. 

A: Well, that's okay, but you've got to control it.

Q: I put fat with it. I've always got fat with it.

A: That's good.

Q: Always.

A: Yeah, good. Because like I said in my book, if you eat a lot of pineapple, you're going to get overly emotional. You're going to go up and out and down and around all over the place.

Q: Uh-oh. What's going on?

A: Yeah, that's why I say. You've got to keep pineapple to a minimum. If you're going to eat a lot of pineapple, you better eat a lot of cheese with it.

Q: Okay.

A: And that will make you fat quicker.

Q: Just fat?

A: Yeah.

Q: Just raw cheese?

Q: Fat and happy.

A: Raw cheese with pineapple. Or raw cheese with a lot... I had a New Zealand model in 1979. Skinny as a rail, six foot tall. Very good looking, of course to be a model... And I got her onto the diet. And, you know, she started, she loved the cheese and honey together. It just obsessed her. She was eating like a pound a day with, you know, a half a cup of honey a day. And she couldn't stop eating it. 30 days before she finally stopped craving it. She gained 40 pounds. Her agent went bananas and crackers. Wouldn't even send her out. The wall went here first, you know, when it goes that fast. It goes here first, like with me, and then it gets distributed. You know, it takes time to distribute it. Just like a baby, you know, a baby got a big tummy there. It's got to have that reserve here to grow. It's got to get sent out, but you've got to have a big reserve. You notice the babies, they have that big tummy and that excess. They grow thick and strong. The skinny ones that don't have a tummy always stay skinny. So, that tummy's good on a baby. On anybody, especially if they're sick.

Q: Wohoo! 

Q: It's the wrong way they say it. I'm telling you, it's the opposite.

If they say it, then...

A: No, it's not. They're out to make you sick, you know, to buy lots of clothes that you're never going to be able to wear. You know, you go up and down.

Q: I can't even find clothes that fit.

A: Do like me, you go to Thailand and have them made...

Q: For you, I'll do that.

A: Cheap. I mean, I have silk suits made for, like, $100. And you can give them a... You can say, I want that pattern there, like a Armani or any of them. And they'll make it for $100.

Q: I'll give you some money and some patterns.

A: No, you've got to go... They will actually fit you and tailor it to you for $100. You'll have two pair of pants plus a vest and a suit coat. $100.

Q: How much is it if I have to go there?

A: $1,000. About $1,000.

Q: Well, look at this way. You get a trip and a suit.

A: There you go.

Q: Wow!

Q: Do you need consultation over there?

A: No. I have to make a living, too. Okay, do you...

Q: I have a question about my son's schizophrenia. He's been that way for a long time. He's 28 almost. What do you think that causes his schizophrenia? Is he skinny?

A: No.

Q: He craves junk food. Well, he has been when he was younger. He started off with serious depression when he was about 12 and then...

A: What was his weight at that time?

Q: Oh, gosh, I can't remember.

A: Was he skinny or was he...

Q: Yeah, he was thin.

A: Okay, that's the problem. Usually people who get schizophrenia like that have problems is they have no fat to fill their myelin, so they keep burning the myelin off. That's the fat in the coating of all the nerves. What that does is the myelin buffers the information. I can stick a pin in your finger and there will be 200,000 impulses that go to the brain. By the time the myelin filters and it gets to the brain, there should only be about 50 to 100 impulses. When you have no myelin, there's no filtering. All that stuff goes... It's overwhelmed and the body, you know, the person doesn't know what decision to make.

Q: Well, so what should he do? I mean, I would be afraid to take him off meds. He's been so sick this year and scary sick. I mean, he's...

A: Just remember the meds will cause intense violence and even murder.

Q: I know it has. I mean, it could. And I also know that he has been...

A: Violent.

Q: Yeah, he was. But right now his meds are working and he's really... The normal Michael, I see.

A: But he's also drugged.

Q: Kind of drugged, yeah.

A: Functional.

Q: He's okay at times, but...

A: But there's a formula. You have three tablespoons of fish. One tablespoon of the cod liver oil that I talked about. And three tablespoons of raw cream. Raw cream is the only fat that will completely soothe the nervous system.

Q: And that's a day?

A: You do that three times a day. So it's a half a cup, three times a day of that. So you have fish, you know, three tablespoons of raw fish, three tablespoons of raw cream, and one tablespoon of the cod liver oil.

Q: All of it together?

A: All of it together.

Q: Okay, so when you do that, should he still be on his meds just in case, I want to know.

A: Well, within about ten days he can start cutting it down a half every three weeks.

Q: Because I really get scared for him.

A: And if he needs it once, you know, he still, with all those chemicals from the psychotropic drugs, he's going to have bouts. He's going to have an hour, six hours of that, maybe three times a month. If he does it for about thirty days, it'll work down to that. When he has those bouts, then he takes the medication.

Q: Like the Depakote, which is on Clonazepam.

A: Yeah, but he only takes those when he needs them. If he does this diet. But this, I'm talking about a good diet and the formula...

Q: He would be hard to get on the diet, I'm telling you. He's extremely stubborn. And he craves junk food.

A: Well, that's, yeah.

Q: Chemical. I know. He craves sugar. I mean, it's not about just to get him to eat something normal, it's not that sugar, it's...

A: Well, if you can get him to drink milkshakes, that'll calm that down. Milkshakes and those formulas. Give him those milkshakes formulas first, and then try to get him to eat those.

Q: The milkshakes, which is the raw milk...

A: Raw cream, raw eggs, and honey.

Q: Okay, get those things. And you think that'll calm that down a little bit?

A: It'll help, definitely. But that formula replenishes myelin.

Q: And you said that fish is where... What kind of fish do you get?

Q: Cod liver.

Q: Yeah, I know what it is.

A: Fish oil.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Oh, yeah, the fish, yeah. And the tuna. The tuna, I always get tuna. You get tuna or salmon, and you do salmon?

Q: I don't know. I always do tuna.

A: Well, as long as your tuna is from...

Q: Ecuador.

A: Ecuador.

Q: What about the salmon?

Q: It's wild.

A: Wild. Yeah, it's good.

Q: Well, I always thought that was wild salmon.

A: Wild salmon is all GMO now. I haven't touched salmon for six years because every time I had three bites, I was into vomit. And it was always the GMO type reaction.

Q: Salmon didn't taste that good to me.

A: I loved it. Can't eat it know, you know, it's all GMO. See, Monsanto's been trying to create GMO salmon for 30 years. 28 years ago, they were hoping the same thing happened with like pollination. You know, you got a salmon and if it registers for their patented gene, you had to pay them a royalty even if you were a fisherman. So that's where they were headed with this. So their fences on their fish farms were so low that 2,000 more fish were jumping a year going out into nature. That was 28 years ago. So you can imagine how many, it's infiltrated the whole planet. Every salmon in the world is partially GMO. So I don't touch salmon anymore. And I tell people not to touch salmon anymore. I don't care where it's from. Pardon?

Q: What type of fish do you eat?

A: Anything that's ocean wild caught that isn't caught... Anything else.

Q: So it doesn't matter what kind. I always get tuna because I know you talk about that in your book a lot.

A: I like tuna. But tuna, you know, is getting heavily contaminated with radioactive material and corexit. So keep an eye on it. Pardon?

Q: The mercury in the water.

A: Well, the mercury is getting higher and higher. When I did the laboratory test years ago, the mercury level was the highest in swordfish and tuna, and I found that it wasn't absorbed if you ate it raw. But that was at that level. Now it's doubled. I haven't done the test again, and I don't know if we can handle that much without some repercussion.

Q: So should I eat something else? What other kind of fish do I eat?

A: Well, there's [unintelligible] halibut.

Q: Halibut?

A: Halibut. Halibut, there's bass, sea bass, a little salty.

Q: Orange roughy?

A: Pardon?

Q: Orange roughy or [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah, those are okay. As long as they are ocean wild caught. Pardon?

Q: Non-frozen, right?

A: Yes. Well, no, there's some Alaskan fish. That can be frozen, fine, it doesn't have an effect. But they are Nova Scotian, New England fish, Alaskan. Well, just the fish that come from there.

Q: Oh, from up there, as long as it's in there.

A: They can be frozen.

Q: And it doesn't affect them?

A: They've acclimated to very cold temperatures.

Q: Oh, I see.

A: And it doesn't affect their proteins and fats the same way.

Q: But the insides?

A: Seal, whale, anything like that, too.

Q: How about the enzymes? Isn't there enzymes in the fresh? Where if it's frozen, you have the enzymes in there?

A: With those animals that are acclimated to that, they swim in ice. You know? I saw a fish come back to life. It was taken out of an ice when I was there in Alaska in the 76.

Q: So just those three things would help him a lot? And maybe if he did some of that [unintelligible], if I could get him to that.

A: Get him to have a milkshake a day and three of those. You can make them all at once and put them in little four ounce jars. And then all should be blended together. You know? Put it in a food processor like a Cuisinart and grind the fish and the cream and the oil together.

Q: [unintelligible] in a blender.

A: You can put it in a blender.

Q: I could do that and give it to him to eat.

A: Yeah. And then put it in little jars and give him one little half ounce jar at a time.

Q: [unintelligible] want it. Usually you crave things...

A: Yeah, but usually those psychotropic drugs destroy good appetite. Appetite for good things. So you have to get him to take it light.

Q: It's just way too much junk.

A: I know, but just get him to say, this is medicine. This will help you get your life back together. And explain how I explain the myelin. The fat buffers the, you know, he got too skinny and used all of his fats in the body and the body ripped the myelin. The fat's out of the myelin, so he doesn't buffer his information.

Q: Yeah, he was a really skinny child when he was growing up. What about smoking? I know he smokes. Does he just feel like he has because it calms him?

A: Yes, it does. People like that use the tars as fat.

Q: So that's what he's using, that?

A: So he's using it as fat. The tars from the cigarettes, and that's a good thing. Because he could be out hurting people.

Q: So it's good to let him smoke?

A: Absolutely, until he's balanced his body.

Q: Well, if he's psychotic, I take him to the hospital. He lives with me. But he talks like he's sometimes, I mean, he's a bit scary. I call the police immediately and have them pick him up. I don't mess with him. Because he's tried to hurt someone before.

A: I tell everybody, if they have a child like that, or an adult like that in their house, they have a taser gun.

Q: Oh, that's a good idea. He's never hurt me, but he's talked to me about it. And he trusts me enough that he can say... 

Q: But at some point you can't.

Q: Well, I know that. I don't trust it always. But I will immediately, I will tell him, I do fear you.

A: And the longer you take psychotropic drugs, the more dangerous he can become. I have one kid that was on it. And he was, you know, he was a, in another country, he was the president's son. And he was partially down syndrome, partially, partially autistic. And would get very, very violent. And I said, go put him on this diet, we're going to take, we're going to throw him off the meds very gradually. And she took him off too fast, I said, half every two weeks. She took him off half every ten days. Because she said, she heard me say that about insulin. So she didn't listen to me about the psychotropic drugs, you have to be double the time. So, the kid got violent, started breaking glass and then jumping on it. So he just ripped his whole body apart. And I said, and I told her when we had the consult, I said, listen, this is a big guy. He's twice your size, I don't care, you know, he's twenty years old. He's your son, but he's a violent creature. He's got, he's not chemically, you know, stable. And you can't feel love for him and say, oh, my poor son. You get a taser gun, and that boy moves any, you know, to hurt himself or anybody else. You taser him, you put him out. She didn't do it. She would not do it. Well, he just cut himself to pieces. So now he's in a mental institution, and they won't release him to the parents. Because that was some serious damage. He cut arteries, he cut, he was near death, you know. You've got to have a taser gun. Taser the sucker.

Q: What size? Aren't they different sizes?

A: Oh, they're all different sizes.

Q: My son is very big. He's 6'3". He's probably 220 now.

A: You get a 5 million watt one, 5 million volt one, one second and knock him down.

Q: So I just, but you have to be pretty close though to him to taser him, don't you?

A: Well, if you've got a gun, shoot. 

Q: It shoots at him.

Q: Oh, it shoots out to him.

A: Yeah.

Q: You don't have to get that close. You don't want to get that close when you're at that point.

Q: Well, Michael's been up to my face at times.

Q: Then you've got to get...

A: Before he gets to your face. I carry with me a 5 million watt, I mean, 5 million volt watt hand taser. Touch him like that anywhere, even through his clothes, even if they had a wool coat on.

Q: Then knock him out.

A: Knock him out. One second.

Q: Do they go unconscious?

A: All their muscles stop working.

Q: Oh, I see.

A: And they'll fall to the ground. And then, you know, if he's real big, you may have to taser him for 3 seconds. If that's not long, 3 seconds, you can have him down and out. He won't move for 5, 10 minutes. That's enough to calm the body.

Q: But you have to make sure he doesn't know where that taser is.

Q: I hide everything from him. Not right now, but before I have. And take anything that looks like a weapon. And he will not have a gun in this house. There's no guns in this house. He used to hunt.

Q: Do you [unintelligible]?

Q: No, I just, that's all I have.

Q: How about your blood pressure?

Q: Oh, I do take blood pressure meds.

Q: Stop.

A: You've got high blood pressure because you need high blood pressure. Remember that.

Q: Well, because I have stress at home.

Q: But what could she do? What could she do to?

A: Well, she wants to unblock... Well, some of it could be just the pressure on the veins. Because you're overweight. To me, not overweight. You're just the right size if you want to protect yourself. You protect the inside of your body. But you're going to have pressure on your veins and arteries. So you're going to have to have high blood pressure. So you'd have to lose 50 pounds. And if you have congestion in your veins and arteries, then you have to take vinegar. Raw unpasteurized vinegar.

Q: Raw unpasteurized vinegar.

A: And you should take it with like, you know, three ounces, a tablespoon with three ounces of raw milk. So you don't demineralize. Because vinegar will demineralize you. So you need to eat cheese and honey twice daily. And have that vinegar three times daily. One tablespoon in three ounces of raw milk.

Q: Okay, so I got raw. How much raw vinegar?

A: One ounce of raw vinegar and three ounces of raw milk.

Q: And how many ounces of milk?

Q: And cheese and honey. How much?

A: Yeah, and two tablespoons of cheese.

Q: Or two tablespoons of cheese.

A: Cheese with two teaspoons of honey.

Q: Two teaspoons?

A: Two teaspoons of unheated honey.

Q: Okay, and that's raw vinegar, huh?

Q: Raw, yeah.

A: Raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.

Q: You know where to get that one. She knows all this stuff.

A: All right. Joan, do you have questions?

Q: I do. I have a couple, actually. One of them is, I have a problem in my neck. And I heard, I got an x-ray, and it's compressed. Problems with my neck, my spine. It's compressed. What can I do to help that?

A: You want to close that door, it's getting cold?

Q: I'll do it.

Q: That's where the door's open to get there.

A: I don't know what's wrong with your neck. Is it tight?

Q: It's compressed. [unintelligible] So if you look at the x-rays, they're hitting, right? Down there, they're getting very thin, or the cushion is.

A: Because you have a very flexible neck. You're whipping your neck.

Q: I am. No big problem there.

A: But if you're losing cartilage between your vertebrae, then honey and cheese together. Cheese and honey.

Q: But you do that anyway, don't you?

Q: Yeah, well, I do.

A: How much cheese and how much honey?

Q: That I do. I don't do any certain amount. I just kind of take cheese.

A: You need three times a day, three tablespoons of cheese, two and a half teaspoons of honey. Three times a day. It's a little bit more effective when you have it after a meat meal, like 35 minutes after a meat meal. So if you have two meat meals in a day, you do it two times after that, one time each after that, and then one time in the middle of the night. In the one in the middle of the night, you have your three tablespoons of cheese, two and a half teaspoons of honey, and four ounces of milk. Remember you said you were thirsty after your meat? You sip that milk after there, and that milk will mix with that cheese and honey once the cheese and honey is eaten later. About 35 minutes after the meat. But during the night, you need to put the milk with the honey and cheese right away. I tell everybody to eat cheese 10 minutes before you eat anything. In the middle of the night, you eat the cheese and the food right on top of it. You don't wait 10 minutes.

Q: Do the cheese and honey before the milk in the middle of the night.

Q: Do you have to wake yourself up?

Q: I wake myself up.

A: You'll have so much more energy. You'll feel so much better. You set that alarm, because your body will eat its own red blood cells. And you're going to wake up with anemia, and you're going to be tired for the day. It'll make all the difference to you, night and day when you do that. Did you notice a difference?

Q: Well, I just wake up about 4 or 5 in the morning. And it's like I need something. I need something. Because I won't be able to fall back asleep if I don't eat or drink something.

Q: OK, so that will build that back up then. And that's again three times a day.

A: Well, let me put it this way. It has in every other case. I'm not God, so I can't say it. But it's in every other case. I can't imagine it not happening in yours.

Q: OK. How long does it take?

A: Unless you're taking Fosamax or one of those. There's a lot of people who take, you know, the bone loss medication. It prevents it. Prevents the body from rebuilding cartilage. Causes bone loss. With that cheese regime there, I've had women, 32% bone loss regenerated in one year.

Q: Really?

A: All 32% in one year. But, of course, they're doing the whole diet too. And they're eating cheese frequently, pulling poisons out. So they're not using their food minerals, you know, other food minerals, to bind with the poisons. So the cheese is doing it. And then they're getting all that. When you mix cheese, you have about, in one, in two tablespoons of cheese, you have a quart worth of minerals. Two tablespoons, gee, a whole quart worth of minerals from milk.

Q: Does it just have to be the plain cheese, or can you have the other flavors?

A: You can have the other flavors, as long as there's no salt in it.

Q: Okay. Like, I think, smoked and Swiss.

A: Smoked is no good.

Q: Oh, I didn't know that. Swiss is okay, though?

A: Pardon?

Q: Swiss cheese?

A: Any of them. Well, often Swiss cheese is heated to 127 degrees. You have to find a farmer who doesn't heat the Swiss cheese.

Q: That's what she orders.

Q: I have prickling under my skin. Even, like, sometimes I get upset or whatever. It's prickling.

Q: I have it too.

Q: What is that?

A: That's the plastics. Your body's sending electrical signals trying to move those balls of plastic. Sometimes it's nerve damage where your body's trying to reawaken nerves. 

Q: Well, that's what I wondered. I thought that's what was going on. Because I noticed it in certain places. Now it's all over more.

A: Well, it'll come and go. You move poisons out to an area that damages the nerves. Your body has to bring them to life. If you've got those plastic molecules blocking you, they keep collecting. In one place, the body has to send a signal down there to burst them.

Q: Can you talk more about, oh, one quick question here. You do hot water bottles at night. How do you keep them on your body? I have done, put them in the pillow case on my feet. How do you?

A: Very easy, very simple. How would you do it?

Q: I've use all kinds of things.

A: Put a hot water bottle there, take a towel and wrap the towel around it. 

Q: Get those big flour sheets, those big flour sacks. Like at Bed Bath & Beyond, it's like this big. That you use to dry dishes, but it's big and thin and you can make it into, or you can tie it.

A: Or just take a towel.

Q: I don't like that they're not big enough to get a good...

Q: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

A: Oh, well, then get a big towel, you know.

Q: I just let my feet pull right out of them at night.

A: You can take sheets and then do it with sheets.

Q: You know, like she said, they're just fine.

Q: Get an old sheet, cut it up, and there you go.

A: You can even take one of your towels and then wrap it around and put a band around it, an elastic band. It's not too tight, just enough to keep it to your body.

Q: So do you always use towels?

A: I use towels. I wrap a towel and it goes around twice. 

Q: And so how do you keep from moving at night?

A: Oh, I move it when it moves with me. The hot water bottle moves with me.

Q: When you're wrapping it on your side and stuff, how do you...

A: You wrap it around you. You wrap the sheets around you [unintelligible]. So they move with you. But you can also do it a very simple way. You're not going to move very far away if you have a small bed. So you get a small bed. And then you put three beach towels underneath you. You lie there with seven hot water bottles. You have a towel over you on top. Then you have a down quilt on top of that. You're not going to move that far unless you're going to fall out of the bed. So you're going to stay under the tent in the heat.

Q: I use every inch of it. I just spread it out.

Q: She didn't have a big one for her dogs.

A: Well, if you have a small bed, you won't be doing that.

Q: You'll be falling off the bed then.

A: You'd be surprised you won't.

Q: There won't be any room for the dogs.

Q: So you would do the hot water bottles the same. Even though you're doing the bath, you would do the hot water bottles.

A: The bath is for the whole system. If you've got pain in a particular place, that's local for the hot water bottle.

Q: What did you say? You have pain in particular?

A: If you've got pain or discomfort or a problem anywhere, you put the hot water bottle in the localized area. The one right there, wrap your towel around to hold it in. Or your burlap or whatever you like to use. Burlap is pretty scratchy. I sleep naked.

Q: I didn't say burlap. They call it a flower [unintelligible].

Q: It's a Muslin cotton. That's what it is. It's not scratchy.

A: I could use that. That's what I thought, you said sack.

Q: It's a grain sack.

Q: Flour sacks were very, because remember they started grinding their wheat and making that. My family owned a flour mill.

A: Yeah, and it was in burlap.

Q: No, no, it was not in burlap. The grain is in the burlap, but once you grind it, it's finer.

A: Finer wheat.

Q: And remember they had them printed too. That was the fabric. That's called flour sack print.

Q: You can make dresses out of it.

A: Whatever you want.

Q: Okay, one other question is that when you have a joint, like you sprain something or whatever, what heals your muscles or whatever? Meat? Putting raw meat on the outside? Anything else that you would suggest?

A: Heat.

Q: Just heat.

A: Heat and meat.

Q: Put meat on that?

A: Raw meat. Take a look. It helps draw it... Remember, when you get a bruise, you've ruptured some veins or capillaries, and blood has entered the tissue where it doesn't belong. The blood belongs in the bloodstream, period. So when it gets out of that system, the body has to break it down. So the bacteria and the red blood cells will start decaying it. So then it'll turn black and blue. Then it turns yellow as the bacteria eats it up. Their waist is yellow. And then that comes through the skin. That's it. Now, if you put meat on there, it happens very fast. Bacteria and the meat will go in there and break those cells down very quickly. Like your boxers. You see those poor guys come out of there... They've got cuts here. They're swollen. And then you see them a week later and they didn't have plastic surgery. And you say, how the hell did they do that? Almost no scarring or anything. Because they put whole steaks on their face. Anywhere where there's bruising. They strap it around. And they go through $500 of meat in that week. If they were, you know, if they were tough. Well, you just take a thin slice, you put it on there. You put a wet cloth over that. Cotton cloth or silk. And then you put a piece of plastic on that. Put an ace bandage over that. They wouldn't have to use all the meat that they do. They put it on there. It dries out on top. And then they're going through $500 of meat in a week. And they only have to go through $20 of meat in a week. To take care of it. So put some meat on it. A thin slice. Put wet cloth on top of that. Thin cloth. Plastic on top of that. And then wrap it around. You know, with an ace bandage or something. Keep it on.

Q: And you use plastic?

A: And then plastic on top of that.

Q: Well, plastic keeps it from drying out.

Q: Well, could you use, instead of plastic, could you use that paper? The parchment paper?

A: No.

Q: No?

A: Parchment paper... All those papers use nowadays, a tremendous amount of chemicals.

Q: Is there a plastic?

A: I do not... I would rather have plastic touch my food than paper. I lived on Jekyll Island, Georgia, and over in Brunswick, which is 35 miles away there's a paper mill. And whenever the winds would change and it would go from inland to out to the island, everybody got a headache. And the odor was tremendous. The children had a brain cancer rate of 32%. Miscarriage rate around 40%. Their paper is one of the worst.

Q: Vernon wraps his butter in paper.

Q: Yeah.

Q: Vernon wraps his butter in paper.

A: I know, and I scrape it.

Q: You scrape the edges off.

A: He's into, you know, the old style.

Q: Yeah.

A: He doesn't think that paper is made differently. Doesn't listen. But I scrape it off. You can see that brownish top on there. You scrape it off, all of a sudden...

Q: Well, it's more yellow. It's an orangey-yellow.

A: Yeah, it's a brownish-yellow to me. So I scrape all that off.

Q: [unintelligible] use paper, my dear.

Q: I know. I guess I won't.

Q: It's better to use the plastic then, huh? 

A: Well, it's better if you're using plastic... If you're using Ziploc bags, which I use, I rinse them out first, because there's a powder that's just as bad as the paper. And I rinse that off first. If I get anything in packages of plastic at a store, I scrape the outer layer off. To get rid of that. That's the powder they make, like, from WD-40, so that the plastic won't stick together. And Saran Wrap is absolutely the worst. I will never get near food that's been in Saran Wrap.

Q: So what do you suggest? Which kind of...

A: Ziploc bags.

Q: Oh, just ziploc. But what about if you want to cover something? You shouldn't do it at all then?

A: You should get a ziploc bag that's big enough, a, you know, gallon ziploc bag, and put it in that.

Q: Or a smaller one.

Q: How about storage containers?

A: Pardon?

Q: Storage containers.

A: All glass.

Q: All glass. But the tops are never glass.

A: Well, that's okay, as long as the food's not touching it. And you don't freeze it. And you don't heat it.

Q: The plastic.

A: Yeah.

Q: Yeah, yeah. But if you do freeze it with the lid on it, and it's not touching it, it's okay.

A: No, it will outgas.

Q: Really?

A: Even if it's near the plastic. The plastic will outgas during the freezing process.

Q: So what I do is I put paper between the plastic and the lid. I can't win, Joan. You know what? As long as your intentions are good, I'll just forget about it.

[laughter]

A: That's wishful thinking.

Q: Put the Ziploc between. Could you use that?

A: Do what?

Q: The Ziploc bag. In freezing. If you're going to freeze something.

A: Don't freeze. Except for fruit. You could put fruit in a glass jar.

Q: Well, you could put them in a bowl and freeze them, and then put the lid on it after it's frozen, right?

A: Well, it'll still outgas.

Q: Really? So you're putting a metal lid on? Is that what you're saying?

A: Well, yeah. You know, you get the jars with the metal lids.

Q: Not the painted plastic. With the white?

A: With the white.

Q: Not the...

A: That, you know, looks goldish. They put a very thin plastic on that that melts off very easily. Even though they're similar, the white one is a very hardened plastic. You have to scrape it off. But the other one will actually dissolve and melt.

Q: Yeah, and those are Kers, usually.

A: Kers, yeah.

Q: Those are the metal ones that have that.

Q: Kers are the ones you don't want, right?

A: Don't want, yes. Ball jars are the ones you want.

Q: But the solid white plastic ones, you don't want. Well, Chris Van Under called you one time. He swore to me that you said use those.

A: Well, with the large...

Q: With just the round ones.

A: And this, under, yeah.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: See, that seals.

Q: Oh, okay. So put the white...

[unintelligible]

A: Nice seeing you again, take care.

Q: What if I'm going to a store and getting vegetables? And you put them in the plastic bags.

A: Rinse them?

Q: Well, while you're at whole foods. You're buying your vegetables. You're buying cilantro. You're putting it in a bag. You're buying celery.

A: You're still going to get that powder on there. So what I do is I just rinse them off. Rinse the powder off.

Q: Rinse off the vegetables that have already been in the bag.

Q: Or should you take your Ziploc bag to the store?

A: Oh, absolutely. You've got those gallon ones.

Q: But you have to put your celery and cilantro in plastic. To get it at home.

[unintelligible]

A: That's a good idea. It depends on how long it's going to take you and how hot it is outside. But if you put it in a Ziploc bag, they'll last a long time.

Q: That's a big bag to put celery in.

A: Well, get a smaller one. Two-quart ones. They're all different sizes. Choose your size.

Q: I just know that when I buy my vegetables for juicing, a third of them I put in plastic.

A: They have the powder in there. So what you can do is fill your sink with water and put your milk and your vinegar in there. And then rinse them. And then let them dry.

[unintelligible]

Q: My third question is about teeth and gums. Is there anything you'd recommend?

A: Cheese and honey. Lots of cheese. Yeah, eating lots of cheese to make sure your minerals, food minerals are not being used to detoxify the poisons in the stomach or intestines.

Q: [unintelligible] after my meat meal.

A: Cheese and honey.

Q: Three and a half tablespoons of cheese and...

A: Two and a half teaspoons of honey. And then at night also, if you want to re-mineralize.

Q: At night, yeah, I'll have to start doing it with my milk.

[unintelligible]

Q: And the other one, I'll share a little experience that I started that I told Christy I wasn't going to tell.

Q: No, for me, I shared. You can do it.

Q: It's not a big deal. But I started getting the clay and started putting like two...

A: Who's clay? Terramin or Aztec or what?

Q: Who's clay did you get? Terramin. I'm not that familiar with the two. The terramin is the one you're supposed to put on externally?

A: No, internally, externally.

Q: It's designed to be externally.

A: You mean the silk?

Q: Yes, the silk.

A: Terramin silk.

Q: It's...

A: Bye.

Q: He just wanted to make sure you weren't buying stuff from the store. The benefits and all.

Q: Oh. 

Q: You got the right brand.

Q: Okay, okay. And I put two tablespoons in my milk and kind of... It was more like take the clay and the milk, kind of alternating. Because when I put the clay in the milk, it was just like a big clump.

A: You're not reading my recipe book. It said you pre-moisten all clay.

Q: Oh yeah, yeah, I did all that. I put it with the water and it sat.

A: Right.

Q: And then once it was ready, I guess I skipped that step.

A: Okay, yes you did.

Q: Once I pre-mixed it with the water, then I would have two tablespoons with the milk at night.

A: It's too thick. If it clumps in there, it's too thick. You're not putting enough water. You're letting it dry out.

Q: It's kind of the consistency of maybe peanut butter.

A: No, it's supposed to be plaster of Paris. That's what I say in the book. It's got to be the consistency of fresh plaster of Paris.

Q: Is that like just runny?

Q: Runny. Yeah.

A: Runny.

Q: I guess it's one and a half times that you put water in, so it should be enough.

A: Yeah.

Q: Well, anyways. So, there wasn't enough water in with it?

A: Yes. Not enough water with the clay, so it wouldn't mix with the milk.

Q: Well, I got a formula from somewhere. I don't know where it was, but that was the formula.

Q: It's equal water.

A: Yeah, but it sometimes changes, you know. Sometimes it'll absorb more water. Sometimes there'll be more calcium in that particular batch, because it's mined in a big area, and it's as big as this yard, you know. So, some areas are going to have more calcium, some are going to have more magnesium, going to need more water. So, you have to get it... So, I said, I didn't say it is a quantity, I said you mix it to the consistency of fresh plaster of Paris.

Q: Well, I've never used plaster of Paris, so. I have no clue what that is.

Q: Tell them what happened.

Q: Anyway, yeah. I did that for maybe three or four nights, and I started to develop a rash on my right side here. And so, I thought, hmm, that's probably not a bad thing, you know.

A: It's a good thing.

Q: I talked to Christy about it a little bit, and we thought, well, maybe instead of taking it internally, I'll just spread some on here and see what that does. So, I did that.

A: And it dried?

Q: It dried, you know. And then I eventually washed it off. But what it did, where it originally had that rash, then it really started pulling things out of it. And it kind of opened up those wounds on my side. And I thought, well, this is probably doing good, but how far do I want to take this, you know. So I stopped and pretty much...

A: Stopped eating or stopped applying it?

Q: Stopped both. Stopped eating it and stopped applying it. And pretty much just went away.

A: You're detoxing something.

Q: Is that what it's saying?

A: [unintelligible] your liver, probably, it was bile mixed with some contaminant.

Q: Is that where the liver would be? Right here? So, what do you suggest there? Do it the right way?

A: Oh, this is much too thick.

Q: Okay, that is the thickest one I've had.

A: Wow, that's thick.

Q: It's really thick.

A: Yeah, it's supposed to be runny.

Q: So, when it smells moldy, to me...

Q: Musty.

Q: That's okay.

Q: That's okay.

A: That's the mold.

Q: It's musty, isn't it?

A: That's fungus in there.

Q: Okay, so yeasty people are okay with that?

A: Yeah. No, that will help break down the yeast that you have, so you don't have to have that kind of yeast. That kind of yeast is already toxic yeast. Because it's built on sugars. This is not built on sugars. It's built on minerals. So this is five times more effective. You need five times more yeast to do what you're doing than this fungus.

Q: Right. Okay.
 
A: So this fungus is a better...

Q: Fungi. What a fun guy.

Q: So she should eat that then?

Q: I had it, and then I started smelling that. I'm thinking, I just thought I'd wait till you came.

Q: How much can you drink a day?

A: You know, I have email.

Q: I know. I owe you a hundred bucks for the last time, by the way.

A: Thank you.

Q: Yeah.

Q: How much can you have of that a day?

A: Oh, I wouldn't have over two tablespoons a day. Cheese, I find, works much better, but if you have a yeast problem, it's a good idea to have one or two a day.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: I take it from minerals.

A: That you cannot, that's rock, you cannot, we don't eat rock, we don't digest rock. That'll help pull toxins out of your body so you're not using your food minerals to bind with poisons. That will.

Q: Okay, so two tablespoons a day would be good for me anyway.

A: Sure.

Q: Since I have [unintelligible] feet. I can't walk half the time.

Q: Poor baby.

Q: Go ahead.

Q: So you recommend this for just people, I mean who should do clay?

A: Anybody.

Q: Anybody.

A: Everybody.

Q: Yeah, that's a good, well the guy that sold it, he claimed that's all he ever did. [unintelligible] I can't do that, I just eat the clay. But he still went from shooting himself with insulin every day to not.

Q: With just doing the clay?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Where's the clay come from?

A: California.

Q: California.

Q: And he just eats the clay?

Q: And he didn't even soak it.

A: I know, but...

Q: What's his face, what's his name?

A: Ray.

Q: He's out there, Ray, he sold [unintelligible] to me. But yeah. [unintelligible] in water. So, does that just pull stuff off then?

A: Yeah, but he was starting to dry out. Did you see him in...

Q: Yeah, I see, I've seen him on videos and stuff, he doesn't...

A: Yeah. And let me tell you, when I met him ten years ago, he was young and vibrant. And he had just gotten involved with that, you know, because of his family. He just started eating it and I said, Ray. You know, you're going to get very dry eating that. And it's going to start pulling fats out of you everywhere. That's why I tell people to have it with milk.

Q: Okay. Yeah. You put it in the milk and eat it?

A: Yeah. You put this, terramin clay with milk, it gives a hint of chocolate flavor.

Q: Yeah, it does.

A: Yeah. Tastes a little like chocolate milk. It's easy to eat that way.

Q: It's a moldy smell.

Q: Maybe a little honey.

A: Well, you have to understand, real chocolate beans get moldy and they have that smell.

Q: Oh, yeah.

A: So real chocolate, the old chocolate always smelled like kind of dirty feet.

Q: Moldy.

A: Moldy.

Q: Yeah, that's true.

A: Mold, yeah.

Q: Do you put honey in it, too, to make it a little more...

A: Yeah. Oh, no, this, no. You don't want to, you know...

Q: You don't want to put honey in it.

A: You don't want to carry that into your blood.

Q: Oh, I see what you're saying.

A: Don't carry it into your blood or anything.

Q: One more quick question. What about...

[audio cut]

A: Yeast on your tongue is a good thing. You're breaking down the toxins from the brain, the minerals. Remember, yeast eats rock.

Q: Breaking down the minerals...

A: Breaking down the minerals that are coming out of the brain to the tongue. Coated tongue is a good thing.

Q: You said metals or minerals?

A: Minerals, metals from the brain.

Q: Minerals.

A: Metals are minerals. Some minerals are metals.

Q: Oh, there you go.

Q: There you go. Okay.

A: When you have plaque on your teeth, that's from your body dumping poisons out of the brain, out the gums. And your body uses the minerals from your food to bind with that and that causes plaque. So we need to remove that because when you're eating cooked foods, when you have old cooked minerals in there, your body uses those to chelate, to bind, to cake those to the teeth. It doesn't do it to the teeth personally. It's that those are magnetic minerals that come out of the brain and they adhere to the teeth because the teeth are full of minerals. So it like magnetizes the teeth. Then your body uses calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium to attach to that and try to neutralize it because those are highly acidic. Your four alkalinizing, main alkalinizing minerals, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium, are alkalinizing. So it's supposed to try to neutralize that acidity so it doesn't burn into the teeth. People who cook food, they cauterize all their alkalinizing minerals so then those heavy metals that come down, mercury, thallium, lead, all of them eat into the dentine and that causes the dental decay. And then your bacteria is incited to break down the dental damaged cells but of course the pharmaceutical doctors say oh it's the bacteria that causes decay. It is not the bacteria that causes decay. Some metals coming out of the brain, dumping out the gums. 90% of the poisons from the brain dump out the tongue, the salivary glands and the gum. The gum, salivary glands and the tongue.

Q: So what can we do to get those minerals and metals out of the brain that's the fastest?

A: Well they constantly dump out the gums every day. So a lot of people will oil pull. They'll put a teaspoon or tablespoon of oil in their mouth. They'll swish it around for 15-20 minutes. Some people even do it for 30 minutes. Long time, also very expensive, not a very nice way to do it. You can do it with cheese. First have your cheese down to take care of your poisons in the stomach. You can take a teaspoon of cheese and just chew it and keep swishing it around. Keep it around, pull it out. Because then you have magnetics involved.

Q: Oh, you spit that out.

A: Yeah, you spit it out. You don't swallow it. You spit it. You expectorate it.

Q: How long do you do that?

A: Anywhere, as long as you want. Some people do it 10 minutes. Some people do it 15, 20, 30.

Q: How long can you go?

A: Well, your saliva is going to build up. You're going to have to divide it. You're going to have to spit a little bit out and keep some in there and keep going with it.

Q: Just like gum, Joe. Don't blow bubbles with it.

Q: Is one better than, oil or cheese.

A: The cheese. The cheese is better because you have fat and the minerals. The oil only has the oil. If you have minerals in there, you have magnetism.

Q: Very interesting.

A: With the oil, you have no magnetism. 

Q: Yeah, because the gum issue can be a problem.

Q: Right.

A: If you're using olive oil, you know, it can be acidic. Make the gums raw.

Q: Well, another thing is you brush with... I've brushed with butter.

Q: You've brushed with butter?

Q: Yeah, and it takes that off too, yeah.

Q: See, I just haven't been using anything. But butter is a good toothpaste.

Q: It polishes your teeth. Yeah, and it also softens...

Q: Doesn't it soften your gums too? Because the gums start to dry out with all the minerals coming down.

Q: Brush with butter.

A: Yeah, brush with butter.

Q: Well, I've used one of your recipes before.

A: Yeah.

Q: It was butter, it was clay...

A: Coconut cream. Clay and coconut cream.

Q: Clay and coconut cream, or clay and cream.

Q: And vinegar.

Q: Yeah, and ginger.

A: Yeah. Well, any fat will do.

Q: Any fat.

A: Yeah. Butter will probably strengthen the gums better.

Q: I might do that.

Q: Would anybody like some milk? It's cold, but...

Q: Sure, I would. My tummy's hurting.

Q: I'm done.

A: Okay. You're welcome. Do you have a question, Beth?

Q: Yes. You mentioned a sand filter for a swimming pool. Where do you get those? 

A: Hayward sand filters. They're anywhere. It's online.

Q: Well, we have one, too, for below ground pool.

Q: A sand filter?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Do you use chlorine in?

Q: Well, we...

Q: You've got kids, right?

Q: Yeah, we've got that salt thing that changes the...

A: Salt chlorinator.

Q: Yeah.

Q: That's the best way to do it?

Q: Well, it's not the best, but...

[unintelligible]

A: Use, you know, only a fifth of what they say. If you're going to use a salt chlorinator, and use only a fifth of the salt they suggest.

Q: So with a sand filter, you use a salt chlorinator.

A: You can if you don't want algae to grow in your pool.

Q: Yeah. Okay. Okay.

Q: But algae's a good thing, right?

Q: Well, yeah.

[unintelligible]

Q. Oh, my God.

Q: Don't jump in that green water.

[unintelligible]

Q: Would you like to drink some milk?

Q: No, thanks.

Q: One more?

Q: I'm just not a fan of that milk.

Q: I was going to ask you about arthritis. And you said there's no autoimmune diseases. Isn't that what they say arthritis is? What is it? It's just not that.

A: We have to wait.

Q: [unintelligible] You don't want to do that.

A: She's got a question.

Q: Sorry.

A: She said if there's no immune disease, then what is arthritis? 80 to 85% of arthritis is Crohn's disease.

Q: What's Crohn's disease?

A: Crohn's disease is when your intestines do not manufacture fat. I mean mucus, to coat the lining. So your own digestive juices and your own acid bacteria eat away at the intestinal wall and gets thinner and thinner and thinner. Then when you eat a lot, the intestinal tract tears and then undigested food particles get into the gut. It's called leaky gut. Your body sends those to the cartilage for digestion. 

Q: The food particles.

A: Yep. And then that turns, see the stomach is the most resilient tissue. It makes hydrochloric acid that can dissolve bone, but it doesn't dissolve itself. The cartilage is the next best thing to that. So your body will send undigested particles that leak into the gut, into your joints, wherever it may be. It can be all over. And then they will digest in that cartilage. Then the digestive acids start eating away at the cartilage slowly. It isn't like the stomach. It isn't completely resilient, but it will do it slowly. So the bacteria that they find there isn't a bacteria to break down the cartilage. It's a bacteria to eat away these food particles, to digest them. 

Q: But in the process, the cartilage...

A: It deteriorates some of the cartilage, very slowly.

Q: Well, how do you change the leaky gut then?

A: You have to eat eggs and eggs and eggs and more eggs. Live on an egg diet. A lot of people are eating 22 eggs a day to 30 eggs a day when they have leaky gut. It's the only thing that will resolve it fast. I had a famous senator from California, his granddaughter, they brought her to me at 13 and a half years old. Her knees were blown out from Crohn's and the doctors had treated her for three years and she was a mess. She went into leukemia from it, from treatment, from this. And you know, her ankles were blown out, her wrists, her elbows, but the knees were the worst. Six months I had her normal. 

Q: Because of eggs? 

A: I had her sucking eggs and milkshakes. Eggs and milkshakes. But older people, I just have them suck eggs and have honey and butter. Honey and butter and eggs all day long. That's all they get to eat for about three to six months. And then, after that, they eat lots of milkshakes to build the mucus. The eggs will repair the intestines, build them quickly. And I need to do that before the body coats it with a lot of mucus. Then, after the intestines get rebuilt, then I say lots of milkshakes to build the mucus.

Q: And so how do you know when it's done?

A: A year, two years, they're completely normal.

Q: How do you know when they're ready to go on to the milkshakes?

A: Oh, I can tell by the irises. Those kind of people, people with cancer, people with severe Crohn's, I see every four months.

Q: Really?

A: Until they're through it. But it only takes a year and a half, two years.

Q: So do you see the arthritis on the iris? Do you see that?

A: No, they tell me, I can see it, but I can see in the intestinal tract how that is.

Q: And what about lupus? How do you...

A: Lupus is a collection of heavy toxicity in the connective tissue. So it dissolves the connective tissue. And it can be from, let's say, you started collecting dead cells under there, and your body used a virus to dissolve it, and you couldn't get it out through the skin. Couldn't perspire it out to the skin. It starts dissolving the connective tissue. That's lupus. Dissolution of connective tissue.

Q: So arthritis and lupus are two different things.

A: Completely different.

Q: How do you treat them?

A: Pardon?

Q: How do you treat lupus?

A: Hot, hot baths, often. Lots of milkshakes. Eggs, cheese, anything to draw the poison somewhere else. So they're not discarding it out the skin all the time. Getting the waste and the acids that are already under the skin. Dissolving the connective tissue. Get it out with perspiration. A hot bath, sleeping with hot water bottles. Sipping two to three sport formulas a day to replace the fluids.

Q: Does the sports formula demineralize you at all? Because it has the lemon and lime.

A: It's lemon, lime and vinegar. It will demineralize if you're not eating the cheese.

Q: You mean during the day?

A: You're eating cheese all throughout the day, plus your honey and cheese after your meat meals. And if you have a severe mineral deficiency, you also have it during the night. But it will demineralize if you're not eating enough cheese.

Q: So I can just start eating more cheese?

A: Yes.

Q: First I'll [unintelligible], right?

A: Most of it's without honey or fruit. You don't digest that cheese if you're not having honey or fruit with it. Pull poisons out and go. I know it seems like an expensive loss, but let me tell you, the poisons it removes, it's like night and day. When I see people, mercury just full, and I say, oh geez, this person will never get well in their whole lifetime. And then I start giving, just trying to see if it would work. A lot of those people, lots of cheese, [unintelligible], some need it every 15 minutes. Everyone who's done it, the amount of poisons that's removed, I mean even mercury, it takes 50 to 200 molecules of fat to remove from the body, that's even going out fast. It's like maybe two, five molecules of fat to take out one molecule of mercury with cheese. It's just phenomenal.

Q: So the cheese was in there pulling that out then?

A: Yeah, the cheese was just pulling it out, all over.

Q: Was it just like magnetic to it, or is that part of the reaction?

A: Well, yeah, ionic pull, ionic magnetism.

Q: Okay. I couldn't figure out why cheese did that. I mean, what was it?

A: Minerals do that.

Q: Oh, the minerals in the cheese.

Q: Well, so would the clay, would he take the clay too? Will that pull?

A: This is not a food. This is not a bioactive substance. This is rock.

Q: Yeah, but would it not...

A: It'll help pull, yes, but this will dry out the intestines a lot more.

Q: It's going to dry out the inside of you. Okay, that's why. Okay, I get it.

A: That's why only two tablespoons of that a day.

Q: Because it's drying you out instead of pulling out.

A: Like Ray, the guy who used to own Terramin. He sucked all the fats out of his body.

Q: But if you did it for a short time, just to get, like, say, the Crohn's or whatever, you could do it for it. No, you don't want to... Okay.

A: Dry everything out. Pull every bit of mucus she has off of the intestinal lining. If she has more than two tablespoons a day. And if you don't have it with milk...

Q: Yeah, gotcha. Or if it's not pre-moistened.

A: Right.

Q: So it's got to be pre-moistened.

A: Oh, if it's not pre-moistened, it's going to adhere to your intestinal walls and turn it into clay itself. Like a desert, you're not going to be able to manufacture mucus.

Q: Pre-moistened and in milk.

A: I mean, you could put it in, you know, vegetable juice with a little cream in it. You could put a lot of things, but milk is the best.

Q: Is that what you do, Jill?

Q: Actually, I do water.

A: Pardon?

Q: No, I do water.

Q: I thought you were doing milk.

Q: I was doing milk. I don't know why I stopped doing that.

A: Insanity?

[laughter]

A: Do you have any more, Beth?

Q: No. How many people are [unintelligible]? I probably can't get out of the driveway because everybody's parked in there.

A: Good. You have to stay. You were asking whether... 

Q: [unintelligible] cheese and the honey together have a different effect than just the cheese?

A: Like I said, the cheese by itself will not digest. Anything that is dried, any food that is dried, has no bioactive bacteria, has no bioactive enzymes. You're not going to digest it unless the body's robbing enzymes and nutrients from some other part of your body to do it. And only if you're starving will you do that. So the body takes that cheese and will just grab onto everything poisonous and just pass out. It won't digest unless you eat it with honey or fruit. That provides the enzymes to digest the cheese.

Q: And you need to digest the cheese for why then again?

Q: Well, your body can utilize it then.

A: Yeah. Those minerals, since they come from a food source, can be utilized to rebuild the muscles, the bones, everything.

Q: So she'll give me honey and cheese.

Q: Honey, butter, and cheese.

Q: My mom was 88 and she's maybe in pain.

Q: She has bad knees.

A: That's a good thing to get her.

Q: So that's supposed to do what for her? It's supposed to be building it?

A: Well, it'll help get the toxicity out of the knees if she will eat some cheese without honey and butter. And then eat the honey and cheese and butter will help rebuild the nerves. And the cartilage.

Q: Well, she'll eat that, but she got mad about the drink the other day. She didn't like it.

Q: She left it too long.

A: Which was that?

Q: Milkshake. That's what you told me to give her. She was 50-50.

Q: Well, it's because she left it... It tasted like mayonnaise or something.

Q: And she got mad at that.

Q: That's good for you, though.

A: Put some banana in it. Elderly people can use banana.

Q: Does it have the potassium?

A: Banana is a melon. Lots of female hormones in it. Good for the skin, good for the joints.

Q: And that's a good question, too, because I have hormone issues. In your book you talk about yam juice. As long as you have yam juice every three to eight days.

A: That's for ovarian cancer.

Q: But it helped me. I think it helped me. Yam juice and I put the coconut cream. And you said to have a banana a day. And meat every day. Do I have to do all that to keep my hormones good?

A: No.

Q: What do you need to do?

A: Honey and butter.

Q: Really?

A: And eggs. Honey, butter and eggs every day will just keep your hormones... Remember, hormones are for emergency purposes only. A pituitary hormone is for when there's a wildfire that destroys all the food. And you've got your tribe going around eating vegetation for a week or two until they get to migrate to somewhere where there's animals again. And the children won't grow unless they have the pituitary hormone. But normally you grow without the pituitary hormone. But in a situation like that, the body still can grow, even if it's not getting the proper nutrients. The body can still grow.

[audio cut]

A: It's just sicker.

Q: I know, it's bad.

A: It's all it's about to make you sicker. Okay, we're going to have to call it an evening, folks.

Q: It was very nice.

Q: Thank you.

Q: I appreciate it.

Q: She forced me to come with them.

Q: That's right. And I had more people.

A: We're in chains.

Q: You don't know my sister's persuasion.

Q: Enzymes. I just want to ask you one last question about that. Everything in raw has to be, to consider raw, has to have enzymes, correct?

A: Well, you can have dried fruit, there's no enzymes in dried fruit.

Q: It's raw, but it's not really... I mean, your diet deals more with enzymes than it does just raw.

A: Well, bacteria make up enzymes. Enzymes make up the catalysts to absorb all the nutrients and utilize them in the body. So, heavy on bacteria.

Q: Well, people consider, well, I have a friend and I was having her come here tonight. She didn't make it, but her animals, she started to feed them. She calls it raw, but it's frozen meat. And so that's not really raw. And they don't understand that, because they actually have enzymes in the meat, the live meat, that has not been frozen or cooked, correct? So that's what they're [unintelligible].

A: Plus the bacteria is destroyed by the freezing.

Q: Yeah.

A: So then the enzymes don't work.

Q: Thank you very much.

A: You're welcome.

Q: Very interesting.

Q: Let me see if I can get my son to...

A: Try that formula again.

Q: I will. I'm going to try it. I'm going to encourage him, see if we can get him off of some of these medications.

[unintelligible]

A: How long has he been taking the medication?

Q: Years.

A: Oh. How many years?

Q: Fifteen years, a long time. He started with the PrEP.

A: Then he's going to be a long time.

Q: Yeah, he was... he's been with schizophrenia since he was 18, and he's going to be 28 this summer.

[unintelligible]

Q: I mean, at least getting more stable and having not so many... I mean, 9 times hospitalized this year. He's been really sick. Again. Once every two years.

A: Good to see you again.

Q: Yeah, good to see you. Thanks for everything.

A: You're very welcome.

Q: We'll see you Sunday.

A: Okay.

Q: You guys, we still have appointment times open.

[unintelligible]

Q: Yeah. I'm having a really hard time doing this diet.

A: You get my recipe book and you get the 82 sauces that are in it.

[unintelligible]

A: 400 sauces. Find the ones you like. It's easy.

Q: And you put it on the raw heat?

A: Yeah.

Q: And, you know, make a cheesecake. She loves cheesecake.

[unintelligible]

Q: What do people tell me is, well, what about salmonella? What about bacteria? You can't have raw meat. What do you tell them?

A: Just say [unintelligible].

[unintelligible]

A: You know, you've been taught some things that maybe aren't so true. I've been eating raw meat for how long? You can say, I know people who've been eating raw meat all their lives. There you go. And they're great and healthy and strong.

Q: They're healthier.

[unintelligible]

Q: Can you sear it a little bit? That's what Christy does sometimes.

A_ The other thing you can talk about is salmonella mainly occurs on the surface of the skin. A a hundred years ago when we took baths two times a year once in June before weddings. I mean, that's it. We took baths once a year. Salmonella all over the skin.

Q: What is salmonella? I don't even know.

A: It's a bacteria that feeds on dead skin. Dead cells.

Q: Yeah, they had to leave their skin out or their clothes outside to let the ants eat the stuff off their clothes.

Q: Really?

Q: So they just used it again.

Q: Yeah, especially people that did not take baths.

Q: Oh, yeah. They didn't want to because that took away their bacteria.

A: [unintelligible] Also to make them cold. There was no bath.

Q: There was no place to take a warm bath.

A: No central heating. No central air.

Q: Yeah.

A: So those bacteria and that fat on your skin, in your skin, was delicate and precious. 

Q: Yeah, they didn't have hot baths where you could get that temperature for 100 or whatever.

A: Yes. But they didn't have plastic oils.

Q: Also I was going to say, all that crap that's under our skin now, they didn't have that back...

A: Yeah, exactly. But, you know, we don't have any salmonella. We have salmonella here on our nose, mouths, eyes, ears, penis. And you have the least at the anus.

Q: We have it, we all have it.

A: Yeah, we almost have most salmonella here in the nose and the eyes, mouth is second, I mean third, ears, and then the anus is the least. But salmonella used to be from head to toe. Otherwise we'd be like snakes peeling off skin. Salmonella used to eat all the tissue. Feed on it all day long, all night long. Now we have soaps, destroys all the salmonella on the skin.

Q: So in a small amount it's okay.

A: Even in a big amount it's okay.

Q: Even in a big amount.

A: Salmonella's not our problem, industrial pollution, chemicals are a problem.

Q: After the war, that's when they all came in.

A: Well, [unintelligible] after the war. That's when it got worse, that's when we got into really processed foods.

Q: Canned foods. [unintelligible] anything canned.

A: Never.

Q: I have to say, I eat canned food.

A: [unintelligible] to handle those poisons. Because you're not getting them out of the skin.

Q: Yeah.

A: And you're not getting them out of the intestines.

Q: What about oatmeal? Can you eat oatmeal? Is that okay? Can you eat any kind of oatmeal?

Q: You need to read.

A: You need to read my books.

Q: Yeah, or get the DVD.

A: So that talks about each thing that I produce talks about a different subject.

Q: But don't you have DVDs that kind of go through everything?

A: Well, no, that tells you how the body works.

Q: Okay.

A: And how the food works.

Q: Okay.

Q: How long have you been doing this again? How long have you been studying this?

A: Since 1970, 1970.

Q: So you just studied on your own, then? You just studied?

A: No, I had a tutor for three and a half years.

Q: And did you go, like, you said you have, like, research notes. You just stepped into research or something?

A: Yeah.

Q: Is that how you find out all the different things? 

A: When I did experiments, I found the truth.

Q: Okay. So do you have, like, people that... Other people that are paying you, you know, like, money for you? Do they [unintelligible]?

A: No, I try to make a [unintelligible]. People need to be with a patient. [unintelligible] Just to be with me, hear me, read my material, and watch me do it. [unintelligible] You have to be with a patient, day and night, to see how the foods work, how quick they work, and in what kind of conditions.

Q: No, but I mean, so if you were to [unintelligible], like you said, there was a nature path, but they were telling you to put iodine on it. But you said no, so there's a lot of controversy.

Q: [unintelligible] mixed information. So who are you, and that's why I find myself such a frustrated... How do you know what, you know, there's so many people.

A: You find people who it's working for. People who everything is working for.

Q: Who feel better.

A: That don't hit brick walls.

Q: So if there's people like me that are, I always have a new issue. I always have a new problem.

A: That's good. That means you've changed and your body's going from one thing to another. That means you're not polluted in one place [unintelligible]. If you have one disease, one particular place, that means there's a lot of damage in that area. A lot of pollution and damage. So if your body's moving from one thing to another, that means that you're toxic everywhere, but not overly. That's a good thing.

Q: My feet are always swollen and they burn.

Q: We're all works in progress.

A: That can be iodine. That can be whatever other poison that you've got down there.

Q: I've been through that.

Q: You've been through it too.

[unintelligible]

Q: I don't know. They would burn when I got in the tub, the bottom of my feet, and it just went away and you don't realize it. You don't realize it's gone away.

Q: Oh, mine's at the top. I mean, they just swell. Look how much they swell. It's been going on.

A: [unintelligible] hot water.

Q: I did. I just did that today. I took a bath.

A: And you keep doing it every day, several times a day.

Q: You can't get a...

A: The poisons are pulling out. Remember, if you eat the cheese more frequently. You'll draw more into the intestines and you won't [unintelligible] so much.

Q: Well, the other thing is, is that, you know, my tendons, they were so... I was hobbling for the last nine to ten days because my... Every time I would get on my feet, my heels would just... Oh my gosh, I could barely stand it. And sometimes with [unintelligible] seats, most of the time, it was one or the other. And now they're fine [unintelligible]. If I, you know, after getting out of bed, I didn't even want to get out of bed because my feet hurt so bad.

A: [unintelligible] Stabilizing.

Q: What?

A: Building and stabilizing. You're on a better diet.

Q: Yeah.

A: That works.

Q: Yeah.

A: I wouldn't be going through this hardship. It's expensive. It's, you know.

Q: Oh, my God.

A: I used to love my donuts and, you know, all kinds of crap. But I do this because it works.

Q: So when did you start this particular diet? How long ago was that?

A: Well, it's evolved.

Q: Okay, it's evolved.

A: It's evolved. I started eating raw meat in 76.

Q: Okay. You're the one who had the cancer, right?

A: Cancer, blood and bones, stomach, and lymph. Diabetes, psoriasis, and angina pectoris, and bursitis. All incurable.

Q: Okay, I have bursitis on this right hip. And you started that because of those issues.

A: Well, I was dying. You know, I let the medical profession cut me. Then they irradiated me. And then chemo poisoned me.

Q: But you didn't have the radiation.

A: I had all of it. And they left me for dead. One percent chance of living. And this volunteer at a hospice gave me raw milk and raw carrot juice and a little honey. Changed my whole life.

Q: Really?

A: [unintelligible]

Q: Right, but that was the start of it.

A: That was the start of it.

Q: This is my question to you. You went through so much with all the chemicals and you were sick. How did you function? You walked out of that hospice, obviously.

A: I wasn't in the hospice.

Q: I thought you were in a hospice.

A: No, they took me to a hospice and I refused to go there. I was still autistic. I didn't even read a book in my life. I still didn't know how to communicate. I could not associate comprehension in words. I see words and they didn't mean anything.

Q: Oh, you were that autistic back then. You were just like Annette. I know it has different degrees.

A: It was bad enough I couldn't communicate. If you had asked me to spell the word bond, give you comprehension and understanding of what the word bond was, I couldn't tell you. No way. So, it was just a matter of, you know, when a child is autistic they function a lot on instinct and intuition. So, you know, when that fellow got my mind thinking of food as a way, you know, then it was I put my, you know, my mind into perceiving, you know, looking at foods and seeing if that will be the same. And I worked my way through it, but then I got given these terrible concepts. And I went into vegetarianism and fruitarianism and stopped eating raw cheeses and raw milk and dairy and got very sick again. But that was my journey.

Q: So you got sick after you got over that cancer then, instead of...

A: I got sick again.

Q: How long did it take you to get over that cancer?

A: A little over a half year.

Q: But how did you...

[unintelligible]

Q: But how do you work and be... I don't know if you want to say goodbye.

Q: No, go ahead.

Q: How do you work and how did you... 

A: I found a job as an actor.

Q: Oh, you said that.

A: Yeah. So you make a lot of money in a short period of time and you don't have to do anything. And usually actors are on the set a minute amount of time. So I got my first job December 1969 on Medical Center with Chad Everett and James Daly. And, you know, it was a lot of money just for one...

Q: But if you were autistic, how did you... were you already over your autism at that point?

A: Yes. I got over the autism soon as well. A week, after a week of drinking the raw milk. And carrot juice, about 12 days.

Q: And then you went into the acting and you were making good money. So you got to find an acting job.

A: I still had a difficulty with short term memory.

Q: Yeah.

A: You know, so I had to memorize... I had to read my lines and then tape record them and play over and over and over again. Drill them into my head.

Q: She's got a job that just wears her out.

Q: I work a lot. But my issue is that, you know, not feeling well. Did you feel pretty icky all the time?

A: All the time.

Q: All the time, yeah.

A: All the time.

Q: Where you barely can function some days.

A: All the time.

Q: I mean, you just have to do it. I mean...

A: [unintelligible]

Q: I mean, I do, but my gosh... 

Q: She can't get on disability, you know. She's got a job that completely...

Q: I'll tell you what, though. I was almost disabled because of my gut. And now it's healing. So how did you do that after you...

A: I got... I got disability for a year and a half at one point. Also worked for carte blanche corporation as a systems analyst. Even though I was an idiot, I was a good programmer and systems analyst. So this one company at a university, a computer university, farmed me out. Because I could write a program in, you know, two hours. And six months or a year to write. So I was an idiot savant. But then when they got me so sick I couldn't even do that. My mind didn't work. And that's why I went into... But I still did some of that, systems analyst for carte blanche corporation. And I made them a lot of money. But because I still had some difficulty, they demoted me. And I sued them. So for a year and a half I was able to work off of that. So I had a year and a half of disability, a year and a half of the suit from them where I was able to live. So three years I was able to recover without having to work a lot.

Q: You said you were given a shot. Somebody gave you a shot for what was that?

A: That's a whole story. You can read about it on the newsletter if you want.

Q: Yeah, I can tell you that story. But like the mushroom thing. I mean, you were talking about, when we talked on the phone, you know how I told you about the pulling? It's like somebody has a rope inside you and tightening. And you said that was all over your body. So how did you function? It's horrible. I don't know how you did it when it was all over.

A: I did not function. I crawled all over the floor just like after chemotherapy and radiation.

Q: Because when that was going on?

A: I was crawling for six weeks.

Q: Do you still have that?

Q: Well, it's not as severe. Yeah, I think it's pulling up here. I'm in the sides right now.

A: Yeah, I crawled around for six weeks.

Q: What do you think that pulling is for? Is it the scar tissue or whatever kind of?

A: Well, it's a different thing. Mine was that I was so poisoned, all the muscles were contracting.

Q: Maybe that's what it is. Is that what's going on with mine then?

A: Don't know. I have to know more symptoms.

Q: Can you tell from your eyes or your iris?

A: Yeah.

Q: You would be able to?

A: Am I going to do your eyes [unintelligible]?

Q: It's amazing what he can tell. You know, I think you once told me I had a tumor in my kidney. I said, how big? And he said, oh, the size of a pinhead.

Q: Really? How did you know that?

A: Yeah. I can see it in the iris.

Q: So you took iridology and studied that then too to see?

A: All of that. Most of it was [unintelligible] too, so I had to create my own. So I didn't use it as a tool until I developed the system from 1970 when I started. I didn't start using it until 1994.

Q: So you didn't think the way they do iridology that are trained...

A: Most of it's bullshit.

Q: You do think that?

Q: Bolshevik.

A: Yes, exactly.

Q: Bolshevik.

Q: Well, why do you think that is? I mean, because some people swear by it. Do you just think their system is not workable?

A: Well, it's not as accurate as it should be, and you're telling people some very bad stuff. You're misleading them, you know. Let's say it's 60% correct. 40% wrong is a very bad misleading.

Q: Yeah, that is right. So you think there are a lot of people who are really being iridologists, they don't have a clue what they're doing.

A: Exactly. Most of them go into a university. You learn some information. [unintelligible] Most of what you get in school today is not true. It's all garbage. Even the history were taught isn't true.

Q: They change it to whatever they want.

Q: You have to go and dig it up yourself.

Q: But it's amazing. It is out there.

Q: So you basically then kind of made...

A: They've been getting rid of those books very slowly.

Q: I know they are.

A: You can't find books on crafts anymore. The old books that teach you how to do things. Old farming methods. They've gotten rid of all of those.

Q: Yeah, now [unintelligible].

A: Even there, they're gone. There are very few left.

Q: I'd start looking for those. Just to see if they're out there. Yeah, it's all technology. Gadgets.

A: They want everything.

Q: Well, I'm a substitute teacher and I'm going to tell you something. I teach junior high and senior high. I'm sitting there doing this multiplication. I've never heard anything so ridiculous how they're teaching a multiplication. It's this weird formula. I'm like, just one of the tables.

Q: Oh, how to remember what 7 times 6 is?

Q: Oh my god, it's just this weird stuff. I can't even remember what it was. She was there for half the day that she was leaving when I came in. She said, I don't like this, but this is what they required. She said, we all learned the multiplication tables. I said, yeah, that's like fifth grade. She said, that's not how they wanted to learn that. I'm like, whoa.

Q: They're indoctrinating us.

Q: It's crazy.

A: They don't want us thinking properly.

Q: No, they don't. So you've got these little kids who are trying to remember weird ways of multiplying. And multiplication and division are just the opposite. All you have to remember that. And they have no clue now. They don't know how to go forward and back, you know, just like adding and subtracting. It's the opposite. They're just clueless.

Q: And doesn't California teach 2 plus 2 equals 5 or something like that too? I think so.

Q: Well, they're teaching these weird formulas to kids.

Q: How do you know when you've got kefir? Just by the consistency?

A: Yeah.

Q: Because I leave my milk out now, and it's like, well, is it kefir or is it not kefir? Just when it starts to get thick.

A: It starts getting thick.

Q: You mean all the water around it? The whey?

A: No, then you've gone beyond.

Q: Oh, okay.

Q: Beyond kefir is when it starts to become like water and the whey.

A: Yeah, when the curds and whey separate.

Q: This is kind of thick milk now, isn't it? And how long has that sat out?

A: Well, that milk came out the cow yesterday evening, and it was kefir by this morning.

Q: Oh, that's never been refrigerated.

Q: How'd you get it here?

A: I took it on the plane.

Q: They'll let you do that?

A: I have a direct letter from my doctor that says I can take three, four quarts along with me.

Q: What doctor is that?

A: It's an MD, James Privitera in Los Angeles.

Q: Oh, so he'd get on board with you then?

A: Oh, yeah, he's on board. He does his own thing. He's all into, you know, supplements and all kinds of crap, but he doesn't [unintelligible].

Q: But you don't believe in the supplements. Even the best ones?

A: Absolutely not.

Q: Because it doesn't have the...

Q: I mean, I'm telling you, I know people who are just shoving and pushing that stuff all the time.

Q: A lot of people are.

Q: I know them.

Q: We all did.

Q: She did.

Q: We all did.

A: [unintelligible]

Q: No, I never felt a thing. I tried every supplement there is.

Q: Standard process and the whole business.

Q: Yeah, and I never felt I got anything out of them.

A: To me, they only hurt me.

Q: They probably did.

A: At some point, I started getting well, and then I was hired by this health food store. The second largest health food store. Well, the largest health food store at the time in the world. And, you know, I was in charge of nutrition and selling vitamins and supplements.

Q: Oh my gosh.

A: So then I began studying them. So then I stopped selling most of them.

Q: There was nothing left.

A: There were 2300 products, and only 8 of them weren't chemically processed.

Q: Well, which ones were those?

A: Well, they don't even exist anymore. But cod liver oil was one of them, and now it exists again. Like that, but there was a, you know, a nutritional yeast that was grown out the whey of raw milk. You know, raw cottage cheese, actually. And there were other supplements that were available. That were actually food extracted without, with fermentation, some other process. But that's it. And then I started taking them as an experiment. And I had all this vital energy, and then I just went down. 

Q: I had no idea that's what they were made of. So you should just pitch them then?

A: Absolutely. Well, you can feed them to your garden.

Q: Really? They're good for your garden?

A: Well, feed them to your garden, yeah. And if those nutrients you want are absorbed into the fruits or the foods, then you can get that out of them, because then they will be bioactive.

Q: But if they've been soaked in kerosene or gasoline, you don't want them.

A: That's right. So your protein powders isn't something you should put in there. Really, nothing.

Q: My son likes that protein powder.

A: It's awful.

Q: Can a person do their own homework and prove that theory correct?

A: Which theory?

Q: That kerosene and gasoline extract.

A: You don't have to do a theory. You can go to the laboratory and say, how do you dissolve your stuff to extract your nutrients out?

Q: And so that's why you're going to sue that guy, or the one who sent you a letter?

A: No, he wanted to sued me.

Q: Oh, that's what I'm saying. And you said, well, you must send me a letter, and then you'll see.

A: No, I say go to the lab and find out if they do it a different process. If it's either kerosene, if it isn't kerosene or gasoline, what do they use? And let me know.

Q: Yeah.

A: And if it isn't toxic, I want to know the process.

Q: You can say anything. Aajonus, if, Aubrey, you said in your book, you talk about your skin, you know, things coming out of your body. You know how we get, a lot of us have gotten older and we've had skin problems. Is that part of the crap inside of us that's trying to get out?

A: Absolutely.

Q: How can you...

A: The skin is the last thing to repair itself. Because all your poisons, 90% of your poisons come out of the skin. But, like I said, if you're eating the cheese, you can get 90% to go out that way. And then your skin isn't as damaged.

Q: Right. So, but you can repair the skin. You can repair with the bone marrow and that will heal it. And then, but how, if you didn't eat raw and you just did the bone marrow and the pineapple and butter, will your skin still heal?

A: It will help.

Q: It will help, but it won't heal.

A: You've got poison still coming through there.

Q: That's true. And that's the raw diet makes the difference.

Q: So you don't have any, you don't have any wheat products at all, recommended at all? None.

Q: And they say wheat, the, what, the more fibrous food dries out your insides anyway. So you really don't want to eat that. I mean you suggest more if you're going to eat flour, white flour instead of...

Q: Why white flour?

A: Or, you know, rice.

Q: Or rice, even though it has the arsenic in it?

A: Well, it depends on where you get it.

Q: Okay.

A: Arsenic they're putting in it to kill the, the, the moth.

Q: Oh.

Q: What about oatmeal? You don't...

A: Like I said, I don't go with any cooked starches. That stuff is in the books.

Q: Yeah, I'll tell you about that.

Q: All right.

Q: She's gotta read the book.

Q: Oh, she's got the book.

Q: Let me just tell you something. I watched my sister eat those raw eggs and that was a big turn off for me. When I saw that I was like, ugh, I can't stand it. 

Q: I don't mind, I don't mind the raw eggs.

Q: Think about it... I, you know, I honestly did not eat meat when I was a kid growing up because I couldn't stand it. It just gags me. And the idea of raw... I can't, I just, it's just something about meat.

Q: My brother Don was a vegetarian for 25 years and got in nowhere but sick. And he went from being vegetarian to eating raw meat. Talked to Aajonus.

Q: Yeah. So he's doing better now?

Q: And he's doing good and he's increased his bone density because he was taking, he was taking Fosamax. And it was getting him nowhere. And he's increased his bone density. That's not a huge amount, but most people 66 years old lose bone density. And to increase it any is a positive.

Q: Yeah, my mom was on that stuff.

Q: My mom was too.

Q: So what were you going to say, Aajonus?

A: Well, like you say in my recipe book, an MD called me. On a Thursday night at 1230 her time. She said, I have an emphysemic patient. Seven years ago, she'd been mainly on machines and bedridden for two years. She's going to die this weekend. What do I do? And I said, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she said, well, I'm an MD. You know, we can only suggest alternatives if the medical therapy hasn't worked for 10 years. Or if they're on their deathbed. So when you go to a doctor, they're committed to 10 years only... They can't tell you anything else other than what's in. Unless they're on their deathbed.

Q: By who?

A: Pharmaceutical industry tells them.

Q: But pharmaceutical doctors are all kahoos. They're all...

Q: Well, it's Congress also that created that law that you can't do anything other than that.

A: Yes, but that's because they got lobbied by.

Q: Of course.

A: And paid.

Q: That doctor cannot recommend an alternative form of medicine.

Q: No.

A: Until there's failure for 10 years in the medical profession.

Q: Or they're going to die, right?

Q: It's a felony.

A: It's a law.

Q: It's a felony.

Q: They'll go to...

A: They'll lose their license and go to jail. Mostly they just lose their license. So... I said, well that's your conscience. All I can do is tell you... Get her 10 to 15 dozen raw eggs. Put them on the bed table. And tell her to eat as many as she can. There's no limit. And so I get a call.

Q: Well, they were organic eggs, though.

A: Yeah. So. Well, not just organic. Organic doesn't mean shit.

Q: Yeah, exactly.

A: Because you can feed them soy that's been organic. But organic soy, doesn't matter. When you make soy for humans or for birds, any kind of fowl, it will kill them raw. So you have to treat it with a chemical and heat. So it's no longer organic. Food, if you're feeding these birds, the chickens, soy. So it's not good. It has to be organic, non-soy fed. So anyway, so I got a call on Monday morning. It was this raspy voiced woman. She says, it worked. I'm out of bed. What else do I do? I said, well, who are you? And she said, well, my doctor called you. And, you know, I had emphysema. I was supposed to die this weekend. And she brought me all these eggs on Saturday morning. And, you know, because it was Thursday night. Well, it's Friday morning, her time, when she called. You know, it was her time. So she didn't get the eggs there until, I guess, it was Saturday morning. So she says, I'm off the machines and out of bed. What else do I do? I said, well, keep eating the eggs. But how many eggs does it take? She said, I ate 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday. 66 eggs. I'm off the machines and out of bed. I said, keep eating the eggs for six months. And then add meat and dairy to your diet.

Q: That's all she ate every day was the eggs?

A: Eggs, yeah.

Q: So I heard you can lose weight, though, if you just eat eggs.

A: That's only if you're eating, let's say, 10, 12 a day and that's all you're eating.

Q: Okay.

A: But I have to eat about 18 a day not to lose weight. If that's all I'm eating are eggs.

Q: So you can just eat eggs all day with nothing else?

A: Yeah.

Q: Eggs and cheese.

A: But you better eat enough of them or else you're going to lose a lot of weight.

Q: Okay.

Q: Well, what about the cheese, too? Wouldn't you take the cheese to get rid of all the stuff?

A: Poisons, yeah. I mean, you can do all kinds of things.

Q: But that shows the healing properties of eggs.

A: Yeah. But if you've got poisons coming out at the same time, it could be a problem. So I don't tell anybody just to eat eggs unless they've got Crohn's or some other serious fatal disease.

Q: Right, because, I mean, you can cleanse or...

A: You want to cleanse and build all at the same time. You want to do it simultaneously.

Q: It's a combination of cleansing and building.

A: Yes. I don't put anybody unless they're near death. Like that woman, her own egg.

Q: Is she still living?

A: Yeah. She calls me about once every two years.

Q: Is she on that diet then?

A: Yep, she stays on it. When you've been to death and you've been bedridden on machines for two years and been sick for seven years... You were sick for how long?

Q: I've been sick for three.

A: Only three. 

Q: No, honey, it's been before that.

Q: She went on the first diet, the Gershon in 10. 11, 12, 13. You've been 3... Over 3, [unintelligible].

Q: Yeah, I've been over 3, but the gut thing has been 3 and that's just been horrendous. I would lay on the floor just not to hurt.

Q: Then she had that thyroid thing a year ago. Oh yeah, oh my God.

Q: Thyroid was just...

A: Well, Gershon diet, the way, the real Gershon diet is not the diet you've been given.

Q: I know.

Q: So she got off that. And I don't know what's going to happen because now they don't even have the... They at least give you the shots for liver, for the...

A: It's all bullshit, too.

Q: I know, but, I mean, my body was accelerating. At least it was going through, starting to, you know, do something. You know, because my, and I don't know if this had anything to do with it, but the white count was going up. And so it kind of stabilized it once I went on that diet. And then, actually, I had blood work done in March. And it's the same.

Q: Did you look and make sure it was the same?

Q: I'm pretty sure it's pretty darn close.

Q: I was freaking out because she wouldn't do the blood work.

A: Like I said, all those figures are nonsense.

Q: Why?

Q: Do you recommend doing any testing or going to doctors or blood work?

Q: Why?

A: I'll give you an example. I have an autistic child that was three years old when they brought him in. And he was just non-functional. That was his life. He's now six years old, three years later. He's in school, perfect. Everything is fine. Talks. Everything. He's a genius. And this is only three years on the diet. He was a child that I also took... You know, he was one of the first children I said, give him cheese all the time.

Q: I wonder if that would help Michael.

A: Well, yeah. Cheese all the time. Definitely.

Q: He likes cheese.

A: Little amounts all day long. And then she just emailed me two weeks ago and said, you know, Samuel is doing absolutely fine. Or Sammy is doing absolutely fine now three years later. He's on the diet. He's functional. He's in school. His comprehension is perfect. He's even smarter than most kids. And so we want to, you know, to do his blood work. And everything came out bad as if like it was the same way when he was sick and autistic. And they said, you know, he's never going to get well. And the kid is fine. You have to understand those signals don't mean anything. 

Q: What do they mean when they look at that stuff on the blood work?

A: It's all nonsense.

Q: But they love to do blood work.

A: Yeah, well, it's all geared... They don't pay attention to the patient. What does the doctor do when he comes in the hospital room? He grabs the chart and looks at the chart, doesn't look at the patient.

Q: The blood work can be different every hour. You take it every hour. 

A: 20 minutes.

Q: It carries things to and from. So one reading is just ridiculous.

A: It's like taking a Polaroid and judging a person's whole life on one Polaroid shot.

Q: Well, and just because something's in your blood doesn't mean it's getting to your cell. So when you're iron deficient and they take iron pills and it's in your blood now, but is it being absorbed? No. It's in your blood all the time. So they can draw it and say, there it is. I mean, that's the dumbest thing in the world.

A: And they don't get better.

Q: No.

Q: So blood work is kind of like a...

Q: It's stupid. I mean, there's a basic need...

A: It's a hook. 

Q: ...in certain situations, but not in most.

Q: Somebody said that a vitamin D for like my son would help him. Maybe he's low on vitamin D. 

Q: That's another problem. We're all low on vitamin D. Everybody says take vitamin D. 

A: Do you know what vitamin D is?

Q: Sun.

A: It's chemical if it's not in cod liver oil. Vitamin D is made by taking an oil, whether it's animal or mineral, and most times it's mineral. They hydrogenate it, so it's a plastic oil. Then they expose it to radioactive material.

Q: Why do they expose it to radioactive material?

A: Sun touches your fat, vitamin D. Oil exposed to radiation, vitamin D. 

Q: So he'd be better just sitting out in the sun when he's smoking.

[laughter]

A: Exactly.

Q: Yep.

Q: And give him some cheese.

Q: Yep.

Q: [unintelligible] give him the damn cigarettes.

A: Well, that's where he's getting the only fat. See, those oils, when they're vaporized into smoke, they're vaporized. So it's a very fine fat. Some people can only use that.

Q: So it's a [unintelligible] oil. What is that oil that you use?

A: Cod liver oil.

Q: Joni, what's the oil that Mother uses you bought for her?

Q: Coconuts.

Q: No, the other oil that you tell Mom to buy and put on her food too.

A: You're very welcome.

Q: Yes, you do.

Q: No, it's the oil that's in a bottle.

Q: It's that flaxseed oil.

Q: See you later, Christy.

Q: Bye, Christy.

Q: Bye.

Q: See you Sunday.

A: Not really. I recommend only people who have cancer to help them detoxify themselves.

Q: I think you told me not to take flaxseed oil.

Q: So don't give it to my Mom either.

A: Well, if your Mother won't eat any of the other fat, but if she'll drink milkshakes...

Q: She loves butter. Just give her that butter. Just chow it down.

A: She doesn't need that.

Q: Give her lots of cheese too.

Q: She doesn't need that flaxseed then.

Q: Is olive oil ok to put on salads or anything?

A: Raw. Stone pressed. We got to go.

Q: I can just talk forever.

A: I know.

Q: Hey, you guys, thank you.

Q: Thank you very much.

A: You're welcome. Nice seeing you again.

Q: Have a safe trip home.

Q: Nice seeing you. Thanks so much.

[unintelligible]

A: You look pretty good. Your skin is looking better. You're looking good. I can see good red blood cells there. Well, [unintelligible] that cheese and get those hot baths and keep up doing that.

Q: Well, and I'm trying to do the lime, too. [unintelligible] Oh, the hormones.

A: But do I get to see your eyes this week?

Q: Yes.

A: Okay. Then we'll see what's going on.

Q: Okay, we'll talk more.

A: Okay?

Q: Okay, thanks so much.

A: I'll see you tomorrow or Sunday?

Q: Okay, I think Sunday.

A: Okay.

Q: Take care. Tell Shirley thank you.

A: Yeah, you're welcome.

[audio cut]

Q: ...recognizing faces.

A: So to curb that, then I started recommending cucumber pulp instead of cucumber juice. And then that resolved that issue. It was only two out of a hundred, you know, but still, it's helpful for everybody to replace the collagen under the skin.

Q: We all want beautiful skin.

A: Yes.

Q: So is that something you can...

A: You're not a [unintelligible], are you?

Q: No, I'm not. I'll take what I get.

[unintelligible]

Q: And then the 8385.

Q: Oh, it said in the email, 375.

Q: What about goji berries and chia seeds?

Q: It was 385.

Q: Was it 385? Okay.

A: Well, your chia seeds will help you have bowel movements. They're indigestible. But they're a better seed, flax oil, I mean, flax seeds are terrible. Slice your intestines hard. But the chia seeds, when you germinate them, they create a gel. And they're not sharp, they won't cut. So they pass as [unintelligible] want them to help you have bowel movements, that's fine.

Q: Does it help pull toxins when it gets gelatinous like that? What about the inside of an aloe vera plant, that jelly stuff?

A: That'll help heal, helps get rid of burn, helps neutralize sulfur and salt and stuff like that.

Q: What about goji berries?

A: They say they're a huge antioxidant, but when you're on this diet, you don't need many antioxidants. Antioxidants will prevent you from having energy, so you don't want too many antioxidants on this diet.

Q: Okay. Too many antioxidants while on this diet can strip your energy?

A: Well, it causes you to not oxidize your fats, and you've got to oxidize the fats to have energy. That's why the red blood cells deliver oxygen, to convert the fat into energy. And if they don't oxidize, you can't convert the fats into energy.

Q: That's my Christmas money.

Q: You found it.

Q: I found it. I think it was in the safe. I think Dan had put it in the safe.

Q: Oh, good.

Q: Because I went in there and looked again this morning, and this was in there, and I thought it was 600. I thought I had stuck it somewhere. I couldn't find it. Like in a book sometimes.

Q: And you forget where you put it.

Q: And I forgot and forgot, so I just finally got in this thing. We have a little safe.

A: I did that with $20,000. I still can't find it.

Q: You still can't?

A: I still can't find it.

Q: Did someone take it?

A: It's been two years, no? I don't think so.

Q: You just put it somewhere where you wouldn't forget.

A: Yeah.

Q: I do.

A: Know where it would be hidden.

Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: And you know what it was, is I didn't get a chance to go to the bank, and I was getting on a plane to go away for a few months, and I said, I can't leave this here. So I hid it, and I don't have a freaking clue where it is.

Q: Somewhere. You stuck it in a coat pocket.

A: No.

Q: In a closet.

Q: In a closet?

A: Buried it in the yard, but I don't know where I buried it. That's the worst thing, because I've got, like, two acres of land.

Q: Ah. Good luck with that.

A: Oh, my God.

Q: Somebody is going to be happy one day.

A: Well, the problem is, I could have probably found it, but I put a plastic lid on the jar that I put it in.

Q: They can't metal detect it. Dang. A good thing to remember. Put a metal ring around it.

Q: Well, you don't want someone else finding it.

Q: Well, yeah.

A: Well, nobody else is going to run around the yard with a metal detector.

Q: So, that's for his, I owed him for an email.

Q: Okay. Email. All right.

Q: What about when your sciatica hurts?

A: Just put heat back there? Heat, yep, absolutely. Heat back there and then get into the yoga position, two yoga positions, three yoga positions. Your spinal twists, both sides in the plow.

Q: So, you want five dollars back?

Q: No, that's okay.

Q: I don't think I know the plow.

A: Get on your back. Bring your back and butt up in the air. Knees over at your ears in front. The plow is when your feet are in front.

Q: Laying on the ground.

A: Yeah.

Q: Oh, that hurts my back. 

Q: I was going to say it hurts my neck.

A: That's what's supposed to open that up.

Q: Oh, really?

A: [unintelligible] cartilage.

Q: So, I should do that?

A: Mm-hmm. Well, you can start by going like this.

Q: Yes.

A: Your chin hits your chest. So, there. You don't have much. Pretty pliable.

Q: You know, with the other chiropractor I was going to, it had me in something that always pushed me back like this. And then, I was thinking of the curve back in my neck. Like, kink my neck.

Q: It's amazing how many different opinions there are.

Q: Yeah.

[unintelligible]

A: Everything is backwards.

Q: Yeah, I know. Opposite. It is. It's opposite.

A: I've had people call me the upside-down man.

Q: Oh, I love it because it's quite an easy...

Q: Did you see that?

Q: It's quite an easy formula.

Q: So, if I had something behind my neck to bring the curvature of my neck, you're saying that's wrong? Or you're not really saying that?

A: No. That's okay. But when you have... Most of the time, the tendons that buckle up are on the inside of your vertebrae. And could be on the back, but they're usually on the inside. So to stretch it, it's better to bring it this way. So you don't snap it. You go that way, you're likely to snap it. So it's better to go this way first, and then the other one will just loosen on its own. 

Q: When you were talking about Reagan, I thought maybe they had given him the Alzheimer's.

A: Well, they did, by all the medication during the heart surgery.

Q: So it wasn't purposely given to him, because I figured they wanted to shut him up.

A: No. He was their boy. He was one of their best boys.

Q: But when he was first shot, my friend heard this on the news. He said, they got me.

Q: Well, sure.

Q: The powers that be, because he'd stepped out of line. He had just realized he didn't own his ranch.

Q: What do you mean, he didn't own his ranch?

Q: The government does. You don't own anything.

A: He sold that ranch when he became a governor, long before. He sold it to Sam Wasserman, the owner of MCA. He didn't have enough money to even get into the governorship. He was very poor at that time. So Lew Wasserman said, well, this is when he was president of SAG first. That's when he sold it. Lew Wasserman said, you get me the rights, so I don't pay royalties on the films, before 1960. I'll buy your ranch for ten times what it's worth, and they bought it for seven times what it was worth, on paper, but they gave him lots and lots and lots of money, everything to do what he wanted. And they still let him use the ranch, but it wasn't his ranch, on paper.

Q: Is Nancy still there?

A: I don't know.

Q: Let me help you.

Q: Thank you, Mommy.

A: So, you know, when he became president of, when he was in the office and president of SAG, behind closed doors he signed an agreement that any film made before 1960 did not pay any royalties to any actors. Bob Hope, all of those went nuts, wanted to kill him, you know. Bob Hope was, I don't think he talked to Reagan for 10 years, 11 years. A lot of those stars ripped them, you know, those old stars ripped all their royalties right out of their laps.

Q: So they said before 1960, so all the previous.

A: All the previous, yeah.

Q: So did they, after that then?

A: All of them, well, yeah, there was royalties, there were union, you know, people going on strike, directors.

Q: Why did he do that, I wonder?

A: Well, they told him they were going to make him governor of California, make him president of the United States. He did their bidding. And plus, he was all for breaking unions. He was the first union-busting president we had. And he broke the unions. Even the pilots' union. He was the first president I ever campaigned against, and I campaigned hard.

Q: Because of that?

A: Well, because [unintelligible] SAG. No one's going to become president and governor and president. I mean, I campaigned hard every day. Eight, ten hours a day. Visited people in their homes, talked to them. And I was also a member of Peace Action at the time. Getting rid of bombs and nuclear, all four nuclear weapons. [unintelligible] Star Wars.

Q: Okay, so I have to ask about Mary Beth. What was it? I mean, I have my ideas about her demise, but what...

A: Oh, she moved into the house with all this, right near all these towers.

Q: With her mom? Her mom's house.

A: Yeah. She moved into another one after that. That's worse.

Q: But you know what, Aajonus? I live...

Q: Yeah.

Q: I live... She spent her whole life on a diet, fiendishly trying to... We want to live. That's the name of the book. We want to live. But she never lived. She just didn't live. She wasn't... I mean, she used to come and get milk from my house because we run a co-op out of there. And she, when she realized... Well, when she started to not feel well, just because she never felt good, she said, I won't come here to get milk anymore because of these power lines. And I said, I got five kids I'm raising. I hate it, but you know what? We want to live. I can't, you know...

A: But you have to understand, some people are more sensitive to things than others.

Q: Yeah, but...

A: And she was very affected by that.

Q: She couldn't go anywhere then.

A: That's right.

Q: So, you know...

A: That's why she went on some remote area.

Q: In New Mexico.

A: In New Mexico. But, she'd already been so damaged, she wouldn't keep up with her appetite. She just stopped eating. Every day she ate less and less and less. I said, Mary Beth...

Q: I could not believe that she died. You know, she saw her son...

A: I was on the phone when she died. With her son. And, you know, I said, you have to sit her up. You can't let her lie down like that. She's not going to be able to breathe. You know, she's going through a cold right now, and she has no meat on her. You have to make her sit up. She wouldn't do it.

Q: She wanted to die. I truly believe she was ready to go. She just wasn't happy. Ever.

Q: It was his freedom.

Q: It was his freedom. Matthew has... Yeah. Because I was carrying our milk bags in the house one day, and there's seven jars in each. Full of milk. And one in each arm, and I'm carrying them in. But I said, Matthew, who's, you know, go get the rest of the milk. She wouldn't let him. She made him come and take one jar at a time out of the cooler for her to the car of their milk. One jar she made him carry at a time. She wouldn't let him be a man because she didn't want him to hurt his back. And then she went into all the spinal issues, you know. And here I am, you know, 14 jars at a time. And this poor kid couldn't, and I'm showing him up, okay, you know. Which is embarrassing for a 20-year-old boy. You know, I just felt bad for him. But anyway, I felt badly because did anyone, was there a service? Was there a funeral? Was there any, was anyone there?

A: Well, they did an autopsy on her.

Q: They did do one?

A: Yeah. But, you know, she was sent back here.

Q: Where were they when she went?

A: Their house in New Mexico.

Q: Mexico or New Mexico?

A: New Mexico.

Q: Oh, they went back. I didn't know they'd gone back. She had lived here the last...

A: Oh, that's right. She died here. That's right.

Q: Yeah, I thought she died here.

A: Her mother was still alive. 

Q: Yeah, I think Matthew still lives with her mother in that home.

A: Yeah.

Q: Well, so...

A: And I was on the phone when she died.

Q: But...

A: I said, Matthew, you have to sit her up. She refused to sit up.

Q: Yeah, she wanted to die.

A: He said, but she's in so much pain if I move her. I said, I don't give a shit.

Q: She's got...

A: So you have a little pain... She died ten minutes later. Right there on the phone with Matthew.

Q: It felt terrible.

A: I didn't...

Q: Is he okay?

A: Oh, he was a little panicky. I said, now, listen. You're going to have to call, you know, the police. Call 9-1-1. Report it. And... Doubt that you're going to... Because I told him how to revive her. And she revived for a few minutes and then went out again. Couldn't revive her. So I said, you're going to have to get off the phone with me. Call 9-1-1. Get them here. Explain what happened. They're probably going to do an autopsy eventually. And you just have to explain what happened and that's it. Don't go to question you like you're a criminal.

Q: Absolutely.

A: Like maybe you caused, you know, the death of your mother. And you just have to say, no, my mother would not go to the hospital. She stayed here like this. It was her choice, and I'm a witness to that, too. 

Q: So did they give any feedback from the autopsy at all?

A: They didn't know why she died. They had things where they said were collapsing because she was not eating.

Q: Yeah, she just was shutting down.

A: And those things, you know, come from not eating for a long time.

Q: Sure. It was just the process.

A: Deterioration.

Q: Yeah.

A: But there was no heart attack, ever. To me, it was malnutrition and starving.

Q: Hello, everybody.

Q: This is Dean Price.

Q: Yeah. Hi.

Q: Hi Aajonus.

A: How are you doing?

Q: Good to see you.

A: Good to see you, too.

Q: Well, you've met them all.

Q: Yeah. I think I've met everybody.

Q: I'm Lori.

Q: Hi, Lori. I'm Dean.

Q: Nice to meet you.

Q: Nice to meet you, too.

A: You didn't meet at the...

Q: Well, I mean, I came in. You had the floor shortly after I came in the door, so I didn't...

Q: Well, I was kind of sad by that. I felt badly that nobody, you know, that we didn't [unintelligible] a lot of service.

Q: She separated herself from everyone.

Q: Yeah.

A: Oh, she was... She liked being alone.

Q: Yeah. Well, she had a very negative... Brian Wellenstein, you know Brian, said that he had counseled with her for a while, because she had a counseling background, which I thought was really funny. He said after a while, she had some good pointers and everything, but he said those two were just toxic to be with, you know, just from an emotional standpoint. He said it just was... everything was somebody else's fault and it was negative and they just couldn't live. And I just thought that was so ironic, because you're the one that said, we want to live, that's the name of the book. I'm like, yeah, because Mary Beth is the one who got us all into it.

A: I know, yeah.

Q: And, you know, she would come to my house and she just couldn't believe that we could live there. And I'm like, it's one of those things, it's that old Alcoholics Anonymous, I can't control it. You know, I mean, there is a certain amount of spiritual allowance that you have to give back. You know, you can't take it.

A: But, you know, she was very sensitive to those EMF fields. Let me give you an example. I had one MS patient. They brought her down on a gurney. It would cost less, you know, for me to fly to Canada. She insisted on coming down because her daughter and her son, her daughter and her little son lived in Los Angeles too. She wanted to use that as an excuse. So, they flew her down on a gurney. They had to take two, you know, first class seats out of the plane and put her on there. It took, you know, like four weeks to set this up. So, they brought her in a life squad vehicle up to my house in Beverly, in Malibu. Brought her up into the house. And, you know, she fell asleep during the consultation. And I just went, you know, to touch her and I got this far. She woke up screaming. I mean, and I went like this. Like that again. She screamed again. That's how sensitive she was.

Q: Is that the myelin?

A: Yeah, it's the myelin. 

Q: So, she was picking up the electrical fields from you from our body's energy.

A: The actual physiological magnetic energy from me, it would send her up and anybody... She had two people taking care of her. You know, each one of them 12 hours a piece. And they had to, you know, she was screaming all the time. When they had to take care of her, change her clothes. She was in constant pain that way, you know. Now she's fine. You know, she was about 67 years old at that time. Now she's 80-something. And I sent her to Mexico. What do the doctors say if you have MS? Live in a cold climate.

Q: I know. My girlfriend has MS.

A: You will never get well. So I sent her to Mexico.

Q: I told her.

A: To Puerto Vallarta. You know, in four years she was making her own food, standing, clothed.

Q: See, I told Brenda that. So why, okay, my kids volunteered at an MS gym. You know, where there's people with MS...

A: Anyway, Mary Beth is that kind of sensitive to EMFs. Turn a blender on around her. Let me tell you, she won't think for five minutes.

Q: That's bizarre. What could cause that?

A: And that's all from living in that apartment, being that exposed to her.

Q: Some kind of contamination of the nerves, some combination of chemical reactions.

Q: And can you pull that out so you can heal?

A: I didn't have all the tools that I have now before she died, so.

Q: What are the tools?

A: I now know how to handle it.

Q: So MS patients, we found that so many of them are from the medical field. Nurses, doctors, why? Is it the nerves?

A: They're around formaldehyde and cleansers. Clorox all the time, heavy. Breathing it constantly. Around radiation.

Q: Okay. Yeah, because it was like 75% of these patients were from medical backgrounds.

A: Yeah. The patients are exhaling the chemical gases from the medication they take. All of that's in that environment. It's a highly toxic environment.

Q: And they all get all their vaccinations, of course.

Q: No, that's what I was going to say. They're very good at that. They're very good at getting all of their shots.

A: Yeah. And plus.

Q: And that's what I'm saying.

Q: Yeah.

A: Plus.

Q: Yeah. Which includes flu shots.

Q: Yeah. Anything that's out there, they'll take it.

Q: Well, they have to take them or they'll lose their job.

Q: Yeah.

A: Not if they fought...

Q: I would say fight.

A: When they wanted to do it in New York City, force them to take the swine flu vaccine... All of those nurses got together in New York City and blocked it. Judge said, no, you don't have to do that.

Q: You still have the rule 13.

A: Unproven.

Q: It is unproven. You know, as I'm in sales, and we have some reps that go into health care specifically, and they have to get those shots. They require them to get shots.

Q: Who requires them?

Q: The hospitals.

A: Uh huh.

Q: For them to come in, they require them. On a regular basis. They have to have their vaccination. What's the new one that they talk about, Hep C?

A: HPV.

Q: Yeah, it's HPV, but there's a couple of them, I think. And they make them do all of them.

A: Hepatitis B is a major one. Hepatitis B, tuberculosis.

Q: But isn't there a hepatitis C also now? Is it the C that...

A: Not in California.

Q: Okay. I thought it was Hep B and there was something else.

Q: I know. Anybody that comes to me and talks about... Like my kids, Miranda talks about getting into the medical field. I'm just like, why?

Q: Waste your time.

Q: Yeah. Even just a radiologist or something or an ultrasound tech. I'm just like, well, then you've got to follow Rule 13 for all those shots. You cannot do that. You can't. Or the military. Same thing. I'm just like, don't let your boys go. Don't. It's so hard. Ugh. I don't care how much structure they need. Send them to my house.

[laughter]

Q: Well, it's like the pet thing. Always making... Oh, that's a question. If you think your pet might have gotten bit by an animal, they, you know... We run off and get the rabies shot. What can you give your animals on a regular basis, or when they get bit, to prevent rabies?

A: Rabies is a farce.

Q: It is.

A: It's not a true disease.

Q: So you don't need to worry about it, period?

A: That's right. That's all a hoax. You make billions of dollars a year. You know how many pets there are?

Q: Oh, I know. Oh, my gosh. It's insane.

A: That's all a hoax again.

Q: Well, they make everybody get those shots. That's just insane.

Q: Our doctor, remember I told you?

Q: I know.

Q: You can't take your cat or dog to get clipped without the shot.

Q: Well, yeah. You take them to a...

Q: You can't.

Q: Yeah. And now they make you do... Like, if you have to put them overnight or something... 

Q: Like at a... Yeah.

Q: Yeah, a kennel or something, you have to do the kennel cough thing, too. And that's just...

Q: That's another shot?

Q: Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's crazy.

Q: Oh, well. [unintelligible]

Q: So, they made the whole rabies thing up, then.

Q: So, I don't need to worry about... How about the bats? I know that there are bats that get rabies. And then, of course, I know... I've heard of a cat getting bit by...

A: What is rabies?

Q: Foaming at the mouth, and then...

A: What is rabies?

Q: What's the actual disease?

Q: Well, I know they'll die. They can't...they get...they...

Q: The blood thing? The blood infection?

A: Well, they say it's a parasite of the blood. I haven't been able to find one.

Q: So, what is the story? Like, you know, the foaming at the...

Q: When you see the rabid dog.

Q: Yeah. Yeah. The rabid dog or the rabbit, you see him... What's with the rabid dog?

A: They're reacting to vaccines that they've had.

Q: Well, how about even a wild animal? They've seen, you know, wild animals that have...

A: That's all hog-wash. Have you seen one? Or is that just...

Q: I have not seen one, but I've heard stories.

A: The stories.

Q: I see raccoons out that are sick. I mean, they're sick. They're not...

A: They've been poisoned.

Q: Yeah, they're just sick. I mean, come on. They live in the sewers.

Q: I mean, people have talked about it. So, I mean...

A: That's the whole story. It's fiction. It's like, look at people talking about raw milk. It's all fiction.

Q: Well, and I get that. Well, and they talk... Well, you know, the deal is that the bacteria, they can't deal with the... There's bacteria in there. So, it's bad.

Q: And you will... If you drink... If you've never had raw milk and you do drink a lot, you will poop.

Q: Yeah, I know.

Q: And you will puke.

Q: But I'm saying... But they're totally...

Q: But it's a good thing. They'll freak out and say, I got sick from it. And so...

Q: Well, and the thing is, they'll say that it's bad because of all the bacteria in it.

Q: Yeah.

Q: They don't get that bacteria is not a bad thing.

Q: So did I tell you when Bryant's... We have a local farmer here that got busted, you know, the health department was on him.

Q: The Bryant's?

Q: The Bryant's. That was a few years ago. And so they called me. They gave up... They wanted their customers' names. They said, give us five customers' names. So they gave them mine. I wasn't a regular, but I had been there plenty because they figured I'd know how to talk to the health guys. So this young guy calls me, he's new, you know, and he's like, well, no, I'm just taking a survey. You don't have to answer these questions. You know, blah, blah, blah. I said, okay, go ahead. So he's asking me about my health and this, and have you ever had diarrhea? I said, yeah. I said, every time I eat at Taco Bell, I get diarrhea. I said, do you? He said, have you ever had diarrhea? I said, because if I tell you I have, you're going to say it's because of the raw milk. How about you? Have you ever had diarrhea? Then he asked me if I eat my meat rare. I said yeah I eat it raw. How about you? I've never felt better. Oh my gosh it was hysterical. That guy was just like okay. Next. We'll go to the next one. But that's what they do. They simply ask you if you've ever had diarrhea. Have you ever had raw milk from the Bryant's? Yes. Have you ever had diarrhea? That was their next question. I'm just like you've got to be kidding. That's how they do it.

A: It's a set up.

Q: It's just absurd. It's ridiculous. Absolutely absurd. Then they come out with a study that says all these people have had diarrhea.

Q: So what? Yeah.

Q: See and that's the thing everyone it's just like my sister, she doesn't delve into this stuff but she knows a little bit because of me but when she was in your meeting I mean she's going what what, you know she just this is all new because we're not taught that.

A: We're taught the opposite.

Q: Exactly. I mean just it just boggles your mind. It's a whole new mindset.

A: I've got to go to work.

Q: Yep.

Q: It's funny how some people can absorb it.

Q: Good seeing everybody.

Q: We'll talk. Don't panic.

Q: I have to run upstairs.

Q: Bye Aajonus. Thank you so much for everything. Hopefully we'll see you not so long.

[unintelligible]

Q: Come back and see us?

Q: Yeah, I'll be home.

Q: I was thinking I'd go to the Bryant's and get milk to use in the bathtub.

Q: Oh, good idea.

Q: 8.50 a gallon is not worth it.

Q: You need to get a new water heater.

Q: You spend 8.50 a gallon? Who spends 8.50 a gallon?

Q: We do.

Q: You do.

Q: Oh, you do?

Q: I do 10.

Q: Well, you do 10 a gallon.

Q: Yeah, I've got to pay for that too. I did put that in this check.

Q: What? Delivery money? Well, your $30 a year.

Q: Oh, my. I know, it's funny. I only had a few people respond to that.

Q: Well, I forgot. That's why I'm worried about you. No, I know, but I forgot. You look at it and you don't think about it again.

Q: Right.

Q: I don't pay attention.

Q: I don't. You want to just scan the list? I mean, really, I need... I'm going to get three dozen eggs from her today that she's got from...

Q: Egbers?

Q: Yeah. 

Q: Does she have more?

Q: She might, I can ask her.

Q: Okay. But pretty much what I have is cheese. 

Q: Are you wanting to order that? Because I've got to order some too. You want me to throw yours in mine or do you just...

Q: How often do you order? Because I just feel like I never get through it before it starts to turn green. Well, but how much are you supposed to be eating all the time, like you said?

Q: Well, I mean, if I have to add it all up, I mean, it's a half a teaspoon, half a teaspoon, half a teaspoon, half a teaspoon, two tablespoons. I mean, so what is it, a half a cup of cheese a day or something? 

Q: Just start taking more. Start taking little bits of it.

Q: Yeah, I mean, he's saying, jeez, eat it down all the time.

Q: Look, I'm not getting fatter.

Q: No, that's not supposed to gain weight. I don't think you will gain weight.

Q: I have to take the baths because I'm not going to get rid of weight until I start taking the baths to get rid of it. That's what he told me.

Q: Well, I'm supposed to take baths, too, though. I'm trying to gain weight.

Q: No, I'm not trying to gain weight. Well, that's what he told me.

Q: What, a five-pound?

Q: I can't go through that. I only want a pound at a time.

Q: Well, I got a pound now that I can get you, and it's older. This is older, isn't it?

Q: Yeah.

Q: All right.

Q: So, I mean, you can come to my house today and get that, because I'm ordering new, because my kids won't eat it when it's like this.

Q: All right, I'll just do that. And then I just got to go buy a bunch of limes, some lemons, and I have some coconut cream. I'll need some dairy cream. 

Q: I haven't seen him for five or six years, and I hardly made... I mean, in some areas I make the changes, but he said it took... What I've done in five years could easily be done in one year.

A: Now, the skin, that's a 40, 45-minute bath a day. And you've got deep lymphatic congestion. That's a 90-minute bath, minimum. Oh, so my lymph system, it's not too bad. No, you've got some heavy blocked areas, you know, like in your legs and feet. And, you know, this area in here. But, you know, you can stick a hot water bottle there to get long, you know, perspiring there and break down that overnight. But your whole body isn't blocked.

Q: Well, what was the haze you were seeing over my eyes?

A: That was lymphatic waste under the skin.

Q: So, what's the difference of that, then? The blockage?

A: When you've got lymph glands and lymph nodes full, that's lymphatic congestion. When you have the waste products that the lymphatic system has dumped under the skin to perspire through the body, that's lymphatic waste. That's evenly dispersed. It's like me taking dust and throwing it all over the house. But my bag and the full vacuum bag would be the glands and the nodes full. So, you've got a lot of lymphatic waste, not a lot of lymphatic congestion.

Q: Oh, okay. Well, then how do you get rid of the waste?

A: I said forty, forty-five minute baths.

Q: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. Okay.

A: Ninety minute baths are for the congested lymphatic glands and nodes.

Q: Oh, that's interesting. Okay. So, my main problem is just that I don't have enough fats in my body to feed my brain or feed [unintelligible].

A: That's ninety-nine percent of your problem.

Q: Really?

A: You gain twenty, twenty-five pounds. Twenty-five pounds.

Q: Christy, I gained forty.

Q: You gained forty?

Q: Yeah. And do you know who walked up to me? We had a large group the first time he was here for the workshop. And I remember Christy Ewing, total stranger, walking, you know, from that side over to where I was and saying, Are you going to gain weight? You know, because she spotted me as being skinny. I wasn't as skinny as she was or I was more skinny than I realized I was. I think that was a lot of it, but that was interesting.

Q: Well, she knows.

A: Well, after all these years, you know, you can see the progress in her eyes. This isn't like other people's. You know, she did in five years what people do in two, you know.

Q: Oh, with Christy.

A: Without the fat.

Q: See, I think part of it is that she is so busy with her kids, she neglects herself sometimes.

A: But she also doesn't want to be fat. But you see her inching up. She's getting the weight on slowly, for sure.

Q: Yeah, well, she said she gained a bunch.

A: Yeah, and then just lost it.

Q: Yeah, so it's hard for her to maintain it. And she said she had different sizes of clothes.

A: Yeah, I do. I have three. Now I have four.

Q: Why four?

A: Well, I went up to 47 inch waist.

Q: How long did it take you to do that?

Q: Was that more of just stomach?

A: Oh, most of it was stomach, yeah. I mean, I put it all over. I mean, my pants were so tight, you know. 

Q: Well, how'd you lose it so fast? 

A: I lose very fast, you know. When I'm in Asia, and I was in half South Africa, Australia, Asia, you can't get all the butter and cream there. You can get very little. 

Q: So how do people go on your diet there, then?

A: They do, but they just don't eat as much. And they have their supplies, but they can't afford to give it to a lot of, you know...

Q: I know, it's crazy. That's real food. Why don't we have real food available? That's ridiculous.

A: Because the corporations run the government.

Q: [unintelligible] baloney. Excuse me, I was going to say something else, but...

A: Corporations run the government. Oh, I thought that would make me sleepy. Vegetable juice. Eat that vegetable juice and I...

Q: No, that was fresh. That was fresh.

A: I don't care. I almost went to sleep on my patient 20 minutes after eating it.

Q: I was sleepy, too. I'm sleepy today.

A: No, but I'm not now. When I knew what it was, I knew how to counter it.

Q: How'd you counter it?

A: Sucked a lot of eggs real fast. And ate some cheese and eggs. That countered it.

Q: So, it's not because it's old.

A: No, no, no, no, no. Because it's just...

Q: The cleansing? Is it the cleansing?

A: No, it's just relaxing. All those particular kinds of minerals are alkalinizing. I have already... I'm at a good balance. If I over alkalinize myself, I get real tired.

Q: Oh, really?

A: I just thought that eight ounces wouldn't do it, but you've got that heavy with some heavy herbs, some heavy stuff.

Q: What do you have in there?

A: Very green.

Q: Celery and...

A: I usually have more carrot in that.

Q: Cilantro. I have two pounds of carrot in that juice.

A: Yeah, but it doesn't look like it. You've got so much green in that.

Q: And I'm [unintelligible] comfrey from the yard.

Q: Oh, that's what it is.

A: Yes, I just... And I realized, because as soon as I drank it, it was... Oh, fuck, I'm going to go to sleep. I've got a patient coming.

Q: Yeah, you can't do that.

Q: No. 

Q: So, how are you coming with your... Did your teeth grow out? Remember you told me about that?

A: Yeah, no, not growing out yet. I started detoxing heavily again, so everything stopped in my mouth.

Q: You think teeth can grow out?

A: Yeah, well, there's a 90-year-old man who grew his third set of teeth. If he can do it... And he lives on raw oysters.

Q: So, what is it the raw oysters do?

A: Lots of minerals.

Q: Okay. So, we just do more green drink?

A: No, that's a different mineral. That's a relaxing, sedative mineral. 

Q: So, the oyster mineral is what? 

A: Builds hormones, growth hormones, activity hormones, strength hormones.

Q: Where can you get good oysters, though?

A: They come from Nova Scotia, Chile.

Q: When he had me on all the oysters, they were 80 cents each. Now, they've doubled. They're like $1.60.

Q: Wow. And how many oysters did you eat? Did you have to eat?

Q: I was eating four or five a day. 

A: With the meat meal.

Q: With the meat meal?

A: Part of the meat meal.

Q: I just think it's incredible that you can grow teeth, because I believe you can. I just feel your body can do...

A: Anything.

Q: Anything. It's capable, anyway.

A: When I saw the 56-year-old woman regrow her finger that she ground off to here, when I saw that happen...

Q: She grew a finger?

A: Yeah. One of my patients, I had her put lime juice on it first, and then honey and coconut cream, and then meat on top of that. And it took her six months to grow her finger back. And I've got pictures. It's in one of my newsletters.

Q: Yeah. See, I need to pull all your newsletters down. Look at them. They're pretty amazing. I mean, I was reading... 

Q: I would copy them, so you have a hard copy.

Q: Well, I just, what I do is I take them out, I copy them, and then put them, you know, copy them onto my computer, and then...

Q: Right. Yeah.

Q: But, um... I'm not sure what I was going to tell you. Oh.

A: You need a second egg.

Q: You need a second egg? Yeah, I do. Um, the pineapple and cheese reconnects your gums to your teeth. And that's just twice a week you have to do that, right?

A: Well, it depends upon your need. I wouldn't need that much because I've been so clean and on a good diet. Except for those injections. Um, but most people might need it more.

Q: But you can...

A: Twice.

Q: I mean, people... I know a doctor told me, nope, you can't reconnect it. This will never reconnect.

Q: So it's just two of them together?

A: Yeah.

Q: The pineapple and the cheese?

A: Or make them into a pineapple cheesecake.

Q: You had told me to... I told you I was putting beets in my juice, you know, for my eyes. And you told me to do the beets and the cabbage together, you know, one a week. I just kind of feel a little sick after doing that.

A: After which one? The beet?

Q: The beet and the cabbage combination.

A: Oh. But I gave that to you for a limited time, that wasn't to pursue. That was just for a particular symptom that you had. When I give you something for a symptom...

Q: And that was for cataracts, and so you didn't see cataracts, you just see that glaucoma?

A: So if you, you know, if you have a symptom, and if I give you a recipe for a symptom, when that symptom goes, you don't do that one anymore, you go back to the other. The normal.

Q: Will the beets help the glaucoma?

A: No. Only perspiring, getting hot in the head will do that. And near the eye. Open the valve in the back, so a lot of the fluid leaves the eye. Right now you have more fluid going into the eye than is leaving.

Q: Okay. And why is it that you just have us do one side at a time rather than both?

A: Because if you do two at a time, you can have eye vision problems. If you're driving, all of a sudden your vision goes out, not a good thing.

Q: No. Thank you. Very nice to see you again. Thank you so much. I appreciate everything.

Q: Okay.

Q: Bye.

Q: Bye-bye.

Q: I'm just talking about the eyes. You wouldn't have your eyesight then? You could lose it just because...

A: Not lose it. You just go blur for a few minutes. If you're driving and it's on both eyes...

Q: Yeah, I get it. 

A: I mean, that would happen maybe one day out of a hundred, maybe that would happen. But it can happen at the wrong time.

Q: Yeah. And why would that happen? Just because it's adjusting at that time?

A: Adjusting.

Q: I see. Yeah, that glaucoma thing, I know that's big.

A: Not if you know how to handle it. It's big if you don't know how to handle it. Fluid just keeps building up in the eyes. The retinas detach and the cornea warps more. But if you just put a hot water bottle on it, it resolves it.

Q: Nobody knows that.

A: They don't want to tell anybody. It's like pneumonia. The cure to pneumonia is sitting up to sleep. Not lying down while you have pneumonia.

Q: Really?

A: Because what happens is your lungs detoxify. So most of the 2 thirds of the activity of the muscles around the lungs are non-functional. So if you're lying down, gravity pushes the lungs shut. And you don't have enough strength in the lungs to fight. So then you think you're now dying because you're not breathing. If you're sitting up, the gravity pushes the lungs open. That's all it is, getting through the lungs.

Q: And then using what, like butter and honey or milkshakes?

A: Butter and honey, milkshakes, both of them.

Q: Okay. Yeah, because I know so many people that are in coughing fits right now. But they're not on this diet, so what do you do to help them? I mean, you can hand them that.

A: Keep your mouth shut and ask... If they ask you, I never give out information unless they ask it. Unless it's my girlfriend.

Q: Oh, that's nice of you.

Q: Okay, the reason we don't have to worry about the vegetable oils in the juice is what?

A: Well we won't digest much of it.

Q: We are getting a little bit.  Is the vegetable oil mostly in the pulp? Is the vegetable oil in the vegetables mostly in the?

A: Mostly in the pulp, yeah. It has to be fermented in the vegetable pulp, you know, I mean mash, you'd have to have a mash, but we separate the pulp from the juice, but you get a lot of, most of your water, I mean your water soluble fats are in your juice, most of the oil soluble fats are in the cellulose.

Q: Interesting, so what are you talking about? I guess, I missed that part. The oil and the juice, okay, you know, the vegetable oils are really bad for us.

A: I'm going to have to go up and check in, otherwise I'm going to have to wait in line, I might [unintelligible].
