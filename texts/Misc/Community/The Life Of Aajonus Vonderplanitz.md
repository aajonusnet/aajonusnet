## Childhood

### 1947

Aajonus Vonderplanitz was born John Richard Swigart the 17th of April 1947 in Denver, Colorado,
USA.

His mother, Doris Monica Sims (June 4, 1919), a nurse, had French and American Indian origins,
and was Catholic.
His father, Josef Garfield Swigart (June 23, 1916), an inventor working for General Electric, had
Germanic and Russian ancestry, and was Jewish.

He was their second child and had 3 siblings.

He had a difficult childhood, born into a very violent family, where yelling and hitting were
commonplace, his brother and his father would often beat him.
He was born with a fragile health that would keep worsening.

Aajonus’ brother was 18 months older when he was born.
The moment their mother came back with Aajonus from the hospital, he felt that their mother’s full
attention instantly shifted to him, and immediately resented him.

He tortured Aajonus daily for 15 and a half years, until being deployed to the Vietnam War, by
pushing him on rusty nails, rakes, and such objects.

Aajonus’ mother was a nurse, so she would rush him to the doctor or the hospital to give him a
tetanus shot, which would happen every 3 to 6 months, even though tetanus shots were supposed to
last a year back then.

1948 — 2nd year

When he was 18 months old, he received his third tetanus shot and became autistic.

Aajonus would later say that the mercury (thimerosal), aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, and
detergents in that vaccine went into the communication center of his brain, the part of the brain that
relates images to language, etc., inhibiting that function.

He could sense when people were lying, read them in a way, “like all autistic kids can” according to
Aajonus.

Aajonus started disliking most cooked starches such as pasta and bread.

He also developed severe dyslexia, text would swirl when looking at it and would give him vertigo.
Trying to read could make him vomit.

Aajonus’ language handicap made school a very difficult challenge.


To compensate, he would try to hold the page down with his finger, but his parents and teachers
didn’t let him.

His autism made him go into stares.

Those displeased his parents, who were in denial about Aajonus’ mental impairment, and didn’t
want him to appear crazy.
They beat him to try to make him stop. In the 40s and 50s, autism wasn’t properly understood
either.
He was made into a scapegoat for issues in his household.
The beatings that Aajonus’ father gave him put him in the hospital several times.

1950 — 4th year

At only 3 years old, Aajonus was chronically fatigue and had fibromyalgia, which gave him pain
everywhere in his body. Lifting an arm for two minutes was enough to give him severe pain.

His parents would hit him with belts to get him out of bed in the morning.

Aajonus always had a high level of sex hormones and craved orgasm since age 3.
However, he reports that there was no sexual abuse.

In addition to his autism, his frail health prevented him from playing with other children, especially
sports.
Instead, he learned to sew and cook with his mother, and was into drawing.

In general, every time there was a health issue, Aajonus’ mother was reaching for a drug.
She would always say “I don't like to give you aspirin because it's not that good for you”, but would
still do it, and quite often.

He had allergies to many foods, cold weather, chemicals, medications, poison ivy, sumac, and insect
venom. When he came into contact with poison ivy or was stung by an insect, his face swelled until
my eyes and throat closed. Antibiotics usually stopped the reaction.

However, his digestion was deteriorating, and he had infections, colds and flus, that would last three
to five months. He was bedridden for about two to three months yearly.

Aajonus’ parents forced him to eat vegetables, cooked, that would make him projectile vomit.
His mother was a terrible cook and overcooked food.
He wouldn’t be allowed to leave the dinner table until he had finished them, and would an hour and
a half doing so.

1955 — 9th year

Aajonus suffered too much from being hit with belts by his parents, so he did his best to change
that.

He noticed that his parents drank coffee and that it gave them energy.
He tried drinking a little bit, and it gave him the same effect, which he was after.


He then took a cup of it, but his parents got upset and stopped him.
Aajonus would wait night time to take leftover coffee in secret from the pot. There was usually a bit
less than a cup left, which he would take, cover with a lid and put under his bed.

This allowed Aajonus to wake up in the morning and avoid the punishment.

Aajonus was still unable to sleep more than one or two hours at night, terrorized by the idea of his
brother or father coming to hurt him, mixed with other child-like fears of monsters.

So in school, he was constantly falling asleep during class, and was sent to detention for it.
So he started smoking between classes, which gave him enough energy for one or two hours.

By that age, Aajonus also learned to mimic language, like a parrot.
He didn’t grasp the concept of words but could register a pattern of repeated sounds.

He cheated throughout school.
He would sit next to the smartest girl of his class and copy her answers, which he saw as
hieroglyphs.
Copying what he saw as symbols developed his drawing abilities, and he would later make a lot of
money as an artist.

The only subject he was good at, a genius, even, and for which he didn’t need to cheat, was math.
He could solve a math problem very fast and without having to write down intermediary steps.

Because of this, math is where he got accused of cheating, but when the school tested him in several
ways, by locking him in a room and giving him new problems, they realized he was a genius. He
was an idiot savant.

1959 — 13th year

The week before his 12th birthday, Aajonus developed peritonits, an intestinal infection, that
perforated his intestines.

Doctors misdiagnosed it as an appendicitis.
During the operation, when they discovered that his appendix was in good health, they removed it
anyway "in case it causes you problems in the future".

They gave him injections every couple of hours for almost five days, further poisoning his body.

After the operation, Aajonus started to overeat, and within months, became obese.
His brothers called him Fatty Arbuckle.

1950s

Aajonus went to the dairy farm of his grandparents on his father’s side in the 1940s and 1950s.

The family story was that Aajonus' great-grandparents got their herd by buying 12 cows from the
Queen in 1860.
The King and Queen of England have special cows, the best in the world.


They were as big as workhorses, Clydesdale horses.
Each one produces 22 gallons of milk a day, 11 per milking.
Their milk tasted extraordinary.

Aajonus observed the cows.
They ate grass, but almost preferred dried grass to fresh grass. They like straw, hay, which is what
they are usually fed in the winter.
They were only fed 2% grain, feeding too much grain could lead to the hooves cracking and the
cow dying early.

Aajonus also observed the workers at the farm.
They ate raw dairy, raw meat, and raw corn from the field.
They would be so hungry from work that they would eat it straight without going through the
trouble of waiting for it to cook.
They could throw bales that weighted from 60 to 90 pounds 15 feet high, to land into a loft that was
12 feet high, with only one hand.

As farmers' diet deteriorated, they started to struggle with 30 pounds bales, and had to start using
forklifts.

1960 — 14th year

At 13 years old, Aajonus was diagnosed as borderline diabetic (prediabetic).

1961 — 15th+ year

Aajonus noted that in high school, farm kids were strong, and that even the athletes were reluctant
to play against them, while wealthy children tended to be thinner, weaker overall, and to wear thick
glasses.
He would later attribute their superior health to growing in a more natural environment, with less
medical intervention, less contamination, more bacteria.

When his brothers and cousins were going hunting, he couldn’t join them.

He remembered his uncle telling them that if they shot a wild rabbit, they had to cook it until it was
brown inside, because there was a microbe that would otherwise infect their intestines and painfully
kill them within two days.

Aajonus recalled an experiment done during high school where salt was added to the guinea pig’s
diet. When its blood was observed under an electronic microscope, it could be seen that many
molecules of sodium were clumping together.

1962 — 16th year

Aajonus got his third polio vaccine at 15 and a half years old, after which, he developed three new
ailments, two of which were diagnosed.


He developed angina pectoris, muscle spasms in and around the heart, which were heart attacks.

Because of his autism, and him being used to pain, he wasn’t conditioned to be worried and call for
medical help when those occurred.

Instead, when he would start to feel the pain, he would relax his body and wait it out.
So despite the pain very intense, he wouldn’t tense up and die from it.

People would see him grab his chest and fall on the desk or on the floor, so he was brought to the
cardiologist.

The doctors tested him, did electrocardiograms, and could not detect the angina pectoris, because
they could not find congenital heart defects or congestive heart failure, which they thought were the
only plausible causes of heart attacks.

So they told Aajonus the heart attacks only existed in his imagination.
They didn’t consider the toxic vaccine chemicals (more than 45) could have entered his heart tissue
and caused muscle spasms.
This negative diagnosis avoided Aajonus getting more medical treatments.

Aajonus had 300 heart attacks between the age of 15 and a half and 22, and 50 of them made him
unconscious.

He developed psoriasis.

He was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, which according to the medical profession, is irreversible,
and started taking insulin.

Aajonus started liking cooked starch again, eating massive amounts of it.
He was losing weight, not digesting food properly, and became skinny.

1963 — 17th year

By the time Aajonus reached 16 years old, he was drinking 11 cups of black coffee, smoking two
packs of non-filtered cigarettes, and drinking up to 3 cups of alcohol, every day.

He had started drinking alcohol to be able to sleep at night.

One day, Aajonus had a particularly violent fight with his father.
Aajonus was holding his father by the throat, but his brother, who had come back from Vietnam and
had army undercover intelligence training, got him in a lock.
His father hit him with a paint can, and broke two of his teeth.
The doctor wanted to do root canals, but Aajonus could still feel the nerves, and would rather wait
for the teeth to die.


## Adult life

Aajonus met a girl, Mary, who was a year older than him (born December 02, 1946) and was one of
the smartest girls in the class, who was getting top honors in school.
They were able to understand each other without words.
She was very sweet, understanding, motherly, and gave him plenty of attention.
He felt strange about it, since he saw himself as an idiot.
Aajonus needed it, since he wasn’t getting much affection from his mother, who had been raised in
a family of 13 children, most of whom she raised, and had a pragmatic attitude with little affection
involved.

Aajonus couldn’t communicate properly, but he repeated phrases from movie actors like James
Dean and Paul Newman, and started acted like them.

He was silent most of the time which was charming to her.

She didn’t know him outside of their personal relationship.

They got married.

1964 — 18th year

Their son, John Jeffrey (Jeff), was born the 13th of September 1964, when Aajonus was only 17.

Aajonus was still going to school, while he had to work to support his family.

Aajonus was attending a technical school and was a computer programmer.
Because of his idiot savant syndrome, he was able to write a program in 2 hours that would take 6
months to a year for a specialist to write.
So his school was farming him to various companies: Aajonus was a junior executive at Carte
Blanche Corporation (largest credit card company in the world at the time), Time DC (third largest
trucking company in the world), and sometimes IBM.
A professor was always with him to write the documentation to his programs.
He was making $80000 a year (12 times the median income, among the highest tier at the time).

The effort was gruelling for Aajonus, which made him even more unhappy.
He wasn’t getting any sleep.

The baby was sick all the time, crying, requiring to be rocked all the time, so Mary was not getting
any sleep either.

Neither her nor his parents, nor the doctors, were helping them with the baby.

Jeff would only be fine for a few hours, and able to sleep when around his grandparents, which
happened when Aajonus was not here.

Aajonus started drinking more, becoming an alcoholic, drinking a fifth of gin at night to be able to
relax, and taking benzedrine (a type of amphetamine).


He was spending less time at home, going out after work to party instead.

He was a terrible husband and father, but didn’t know how to get out of it.

He still couldn’t even spell the word “the”.

1967 — 21th year

At 19 years old, he developed an ulcer.

He realized it when he started vomiting blood in large quantity, cups of blood, so he went to the
hospital, and they found a huge ulcer.

Aajonus left his wife and child around that time, and went to California where the weather was
warmer, into a small two-bedroom house in Beverly Hills, with all wood flooring.

He continued to drink.

Aajonus’ youngest uncle, Lanny, was getting a doctorate at UCLA.
They were experimenting with LSD, and Aajonus became one of the test subjects.
He was given 720 micrograms in 14 hours and had no reaction to it.

At the time, he was almost only eating donuts, cereals. He loved Rice Kripsies and would add four
heaping tablespoons of sugar to it. He could sometimes eat several packages in a day.
He was eating a well done steak once in the evening, and some eggs, which was his only decent
meal.

The doctors gave him Maalox, which is just chalk and liquid chalk) to absorb all of the hydrochloric
acid, making him unable to digest food.

Aajonus then developed cancer right next to the ulcer, and they decided they had to do a vagotomy
pyloroplasty, a stomach surgery.

Aajonus didn’t understand what the doctor was saying and just accepted the surgery.

They severed all the vagus nerves to the stomach, preventing him from secreting hydrochloric acid,
and putting him in the same category as octogenarians who can't digest food, especially protein,
properly.
They also told him that he couldn’t eat anything raw anymore, even a banana or apple had to be
steamed, or cooked, or he could die from bacterial infections, since without secreting hydrochloric
acid any longer, he couldn’t kill the bacteria from the foods he ate.

After that, eating cooked meat would make Aajonus break out in pustules the next morning,
everywhere from his knees to his head, including in his scalp. One person described him as looking
like raw hamburger.


## Medical Death Sentence

Within a few months, the surgery became tumorous, the entire 6-inch incision on his stomach
turned tumorous all the way from the outer skin to the stomach sometimes, a large one, as far as an
inch and a half wide, up to three quarters of an inch high.

So they told him they need to give him radiation therapy.

He had 10 weeks of intense radiation treatment.

That caused a huge formation of scar tissue which was benign (which Aajonus would discover later
is worse than “malignant” tumors).

1968 — 22nd year

It metastastized by February, before his 21st birthday.

Aajonus developed blood and bone cancer, multiple myeloma, within one month.

The radiation therapy disintegrated the bone around his teeth, causing them to move loosely around
the gums.
Biting his teeth would make him bleed up to a half a cup of blood in a couple hours.
As a result, he was getting two blood transfusions per week.

Since he couldn’t chew, his foods had to be blended and liquefied.
Glazed or powdered donuts blended with RC Cola or Sprite, cereals blended with milk.
He drank these foods slowly through thick straws.

By that point, he had become a semi-invalid.

It would take him five minutes to sit down, be was slower than a turtle.
If he tried to move a few inches, his back would be in excruciating pain, because of the radiation
treatment cauterizing his spine. It was hardened to the point a movement would scrape he nerves
between the vertebrae, which caused the pain.

They gave him chemotherapy, for a short time.

Aajonus then developed lymphatic cancer, lymphoma, within one month, as well as psoriasis,
bursitis, and arthritis.

He became a total invalid.
He could not sit, walk, or even lie on a bed. He had to lie on a hard surface, so he lied on the
wooden floor. He couldn’t even use support, because it would bend his spine; it would curve it and
cause excruciating pain.
He could only use his arms and elbows, and had to crawl like a worm.


So far:
At 20 years old, Aajonus had a stomach ulcer.
The treatment for that gave him a tumor alongside the ulcer.
The treatment for that (surgery) made the cancer spread from the stomach.
The treatment for that, irradiation, gave him blood and bone cancer, which has a less than 0.01%
chance of survival.
The treatment for that, chemotherapy, gave him lymph cancer.
At that point, he had 8 “incurable” diseases, including four types of cancer: of the blood, bone,
stomach, and lymph, and four that he had had since he was a child: juvenile diabetes, psoriasis,
angina pectoris and bursitis.
He was supposed to die at 21 years old, after going through all the medical therapies.

Before the radiation and chemo treatments, Aajonus’ height was 5'7.6".
Afterwards, it was 5'6.9".

The doctors gave Aajonus a three week death prognosis.

They wanted him to continue the chemotherapy, but Aajonus refused.
He preferred to die than be completely crippled for the rest of what remained of his life.

The radiation and chemo therapies made his dental situation extreme, and his gums were bleeding
from the slightest touch.
The doctors wanted to remove all his teeth, but he refused as well.
He preferred to die with all his teeth.

He also refused to go into a death home, a hospice, waiting for his death, with other people who are
also suffering.
He was autistic and couldn’t be understood by others, so he didn’t want to be humiliated in his last
few days.
So he decided to stay in his house, that he could still afford thanks to the money he had made with
his programming job, although he was now unable to work.

Because of his inability to move, Aajonus was defecating, urinating, and vomiting all over himself,
on the floor.
He would have to move from clean spot to clean spot in his living dining room, which was 35 feet
long by 20 feet wide, with no furniture, leaving him plenty of space.

He could hardly sleep more than 10 minutes at a time without waking up in excruciating pain.

## Raw Food Revival

Two volunteers from the hospice that he refused to stay in offered to come 2 to 3 days a week to
clean, shop for him and prepare his food (the blended donut and soft drink mixtures).

One of them was a 17 year old boy, Steve Flanagan, a singer who was a member of “The Going
Thing”, a group hired by the Ford Motor Company to promote their new Mach 1. He was making a
lot of money from it and travelling with the group. He had lied about his age, falsifying his birth
certificate, pretending to be 18, so that he could be hired.


Aajonus identified him as an African American boy, but he actually had African, Indian, and Irish
origins.
He was between 6’2” and 6’4”.

He described him a compassionate individual and as a magnificent young fellow. very advanced for
his age.

He offered Aajonus raw carrot juice and raw milk.
He gave him a small booklet written by a woman who had cured herself of cancer by drinking raw
carrot juice. Aajonus thought it bizarre and unrealistic, but would read the book anyway.

Aajonus drank the raw carrot juice and raw milk, not expecting anything. He was actually expecting
the carrot juice to taste bad, just like the cooked carrots his mother forced him to eat.
After radiation therapy in the amounts he received, and chemotherapy, everything tasted “like
postage stamp glue or cardboard”.
To his surprise, those two raw foods were delicious.
The milk still tasted a bit metallic, as Aajonus was eliminating heavy metals, but it was still
palatable, and he was craving it.
He kept drinking them, not for any health perceived health benefit, but simply because they were
the only thing that tasted good.

He stopped eating other foods, but kept smoking, because it gave him energy.

Aajonus called Steve and told him.

He also called his uncle at UCLA, and because he was able to have an intelligent conversation with
him, his uncle thought it was a friend of his making a prank, until Aajonus gave him proof it was
him.
He then told Aajonus his improvement may not have been linked to the food, but to parts of his
brain finally activating.

Within 10 to 12 days of drinking those together in equal amounts on a daily basis, Aajonus’ autism
and dyslexia reversed.
He became able to understand language, how it functions, its structure, the grammar, although he
had no vocabulary. He was enthusiastic.

Steve had grown up in Watts, and Aajonus didn’t learn how he had discovered raw milk.
Although he had presented raw foods to Aajonus, he wasn’t fully into raw foods, and also ated
cooked dairy, some fresh fruits and vegetables.

Aajonus was still in excruciating pain for 18 hours a day.

Unable to tolerate it any further, he tried to drown in a hot bath.
He thought the heat, around 110°F, would numb him and allow him to die while sleeping.

Instead of drowning, the bath kept him afloat and he slept for 2 hours, the first time in almost a year,
and woke up feeling much better.

That was his first suicide attempt that would lead to a key health discovery; the therapeutic effects
of hot baths would later become an important part of his work.


He began living in the bathtub, reheating the water every 20 minutes to an hour, which kept
working efficiently at reducing his pain.

Since Aajonus didn’t have any more money, he got evicted from his house, and moved to an
apartment.
He became an actor, because it didn’t require too much work, although memorizing lines was hard
for him, especially since he had had only short-term memory for a long time.

His condition continued to improve over the next 2 years.
His teeth started to stabilize.

If Aajonus stopped drinking the raw carrot juice, dyslexia returned.

## Nutritionist Career Beginnings

1969 — 23rd year

By that time, the bone around his teeth had regrown pretty solidly, although not fully yet. He wasn’t
bleeding anymore.

Aajonus still expected to die, but he was now interested in investigating nutrition and started
studying it.
He had never been able to read more than 20 pages of a book, but now could.

He had ran out of money, so he called Steve Flanagan and borrowed $110 from him.
At the time, a book could be purchased for $1 or $2.
Steve brought a wheelchair, and they went together to the store, where Aajonus spent the money on
nutrition books.

Aajonus’ uncle told him to read the book Siddartha, telling him he was a republican asshole from
growing up in this Cincinnati environment like his father. Aajonus didn’t understand what he was
saying, but bought the book.
And so Aajonus read his first book at 22 years old, which was around 82 pages long.

It took him a full week, 16 hours a day, because he had no vocabulary. He had to look up the
definitions of the words recursively, to learn the definition of the words in the definition as well. He
spent 90% of the time reading the dictionary.

After reading the book, Aajonus was surprised that someone could do so much in one life.
It gave him a different perspective.

He became passionate about the topic.

Aajonus’ nutritional career unofficially began in 1969.
Since he hadn't died in 1968 as doctors announced, he considered he thought he had some answers
to better health.


He started experimenting with different diets, and his own versions of them.
He also began experimenting with people who asked him for help for their health issues.

As Aajonus gained his communication abilities, he started learning, but also sometimes went in
wrong directions.
He learned about vegetarianism and other approaches that are wrong. Because of his autism, he
didn’t even know what was vegetarianism before.

He started following certain ideals over his intuition.

## Fruitarianism Period

He pushed people into veganism, or fruitarianism, believing the human body was not carnivorous,
that meat was poison; and gave bad karma.
He didn’t realize that the human body is very different from a herbivore’s, didn’t consider that
something had to be killed to sustain life, whether a plant or animal, and that only cooked meats
contain poisons (such as lipid peroxides and heterocyclic amines).

He drank distilled water for nearly two years, until 1970. His skin became edemic, thinner, and
psoriasis increased.

The macrobiotic diet seemed to put his cancers in remission but worsened his diabetes and
psoriasis.

Later, Aajonus would think back on this time and wonder how, with the little knowledge he had,
mostly about disease, not health, he felt confident enough, arrogant even, to advise people. He had
good intuition.

In his early years of practice, his advice was ambivalent, helping some people, and hurting others.
People would not go fully vegan as he did, but would start eating more raw foods which improved
their health.

Aajonus joined several nutritional classes at major universities, but stopped after a month, judging
that what they were teaching was extrapolation.

Aajonus was tutored by Los Angeles’ top nutritionist of the time, Bruno Corigliano, for 3.5 years.

Bruno was from an Italian family than used food as family. 70-75% of his diet was raw foods.

He was an unconventional doctor that quit during his year of doctorate, as he was seeing a gradual
push towards all-artificial medicine, and then became a nutritionist.

During his time under Bruno, Aajonus experimented with vitamin supplements.

Bruno was fat, but fat-phobic.
However, the more Aajonus ate and the fatter he got, the healthier he became.
So Aajonus eventually went in his own direction.


Because he was trying to heal, Aajonus went to various healers.
He went to a palm reader and an astrologer, and learned their techniques.
He was good at anything he attempted.
An international bank manager for Bank of America would come once a year to ask him about
certain investments; and would pay Aajonus $50 to $100 to answer three questions.

He began studying iridology around October of 1969.

He began only eating raw foods, a fruitarian vegan diet.
He had stopped eating raw milk, and eggs and thought that was the ideal diet.

During his fruitarian phase, Aajonus mostly ate mono-meals.
He observed the effects from particular foods, including in relation to disease.

## The End of the “Dick” Life

During the spring, Aajonus had a near-death experience.

His uncle made him try a chemical form of psilocybin, and a mixture of hashish and marijuana.
He realized his body temperature was dangerously low, and he turned on the heater at the highest
setting.

He went on a trip where his being left his body and started travelling toward the Sun. At one point,
he felt like he had become the sun, as strange as it seemed.
During this experience, Aajonus saw his life of sickness and anger. He realized he wanted to leave
that life behind, his life as “Dick”, as he was called (from his middle name, Richard).
He got a desire to come back to Earth, and woke up.

When he came back, he craved bread with garlic butter. He ate it, which raised his blood pressure.
Aajonus detailed his event in more detail in his book We Want To Live.

1970 — 24th year

From the moment Aajonus first drank the raw carrot juice and raw milk, it took him 2.5 years to
regenerate the bone around his teeth, for him to be able to chew foods again.

## Actor Career

Aajonus became an actor.
He auditioned for commercials, TV, and films.

During auditions, he would sometimes recall the times he had to read in front of classmates and was
ridiculed for his autism, and he would become paralysed by fear.


At 23 years old, Aajonus started meditating to control his over-emotionality, but still failed some
auditions, because his imbalance in those moments would make his acting either too overly
emotional, or too restrained.

Aajonus played in soap operas, including, ironically, making appearances in General Hospital for
5.5 years, in Medical Center for a year, and playing a doctor in One Life To Live for a year.

In some scenes, he had to pretend to drink coffee.
He would not drink it and just let it touch his tongue, but it would give him a buzz that would make
him shake.

1971 — 25th year

In 1971, Aajonus noticed for the first time that the state of California and the federal government
were trying to interfere with people’s rights to good, healthy food.

Aajonus was offered a $7.5 million dollars contract to be the Winston man, which he rejected out of
principle. He did not want to advertize smoking which is too damaging to health.

## Living in the Wild

1972 — 26th year

At 27, Aajonus had plenty of energy, and his pain levels became tolerable, but he was often
extremely hungry and would overeat to the point of vomiting.

He was searching for ways to complete his healing, wanting to reverse the damage done by the
medical therapies and to not suffer any issue from his past diseases.

He knew he would not find those answers in modern society, which operated on unproven theories,
and where the medical profession was run by the pharmaceutical industry.
He thought animals and more primitive people had innate wisdom about health, and wanted first-
hand experience.

He took a bicycle and started a 2.5 years trip all over North America from coast to coast, 5 times
across the United States, and from Alaska to Yucatan, Mexico.

He lived off the earth, picking fruit that he could find, in trees, bushes, vines.
He slept on the ground, and in trees when it rained.
He didn’t find many wild fruit trees, and they were often not in season. Berries were more common,
but often eaten by birds.

The living conditions were strenuous, more stressful than the emotional stress people experience
from an indoors job, according to him.
He had to make a fire every time, and that alone was a challenge. He couldn’t when it was windy or
raining.
The temperature changes from day to night could be of 80 degrees.


He visited Inuit and Maya tribes, living with four of them.

He observed healthy animals for weeks at a time.

The tribes he lived, Yaqui in Northern California, the old Mayans in the Yucatan, the Sioux Indians
in the Dakotas, and the Inuit in Alaska, all told him to eat raw meat, and although he believed in raw
foods, he was too scared to try with meat, because of the surgery that severed all the vagus nerves
from his stomach, that prevented him from secreting hydrochloric acid and left him exposed to
bacteria and other infections.

He thought they were trying to trick him and wanted him to die, to take revenge on the white man.

One time, the tribe pulled out a food that they buried in the ground for months.
The smell was horrible to Aajonus, but they liked it, the children were even happily jumping
around.
Each child ate a pound of it, and each adult two to three pounds.
They offered some to Aajonus, who tried it. He felt warm, even though it was mid-September.
They told him it was made from caribou meat. They called this decomposed food high meat,
because of the high it gives them.
Aajonus didn’t know meat could mold. The high meat looked like a green ball, so Aajonus didn’t
believe them and thought it was plant matter.

Despite his open approach to finding health, Aajonus was still close-minded, as he considered only
veganism was right.

Aajonus loved animals.
He was a proselytizer of veganism, telling people killing is bad, when it came to animals.

The physical stress from living outside, and from his intense travelling, helped him use up all the
sugar he was eating from fruits.

However, his diabetes symptoms were showing strongly. If standing up from a sitting, or lying
down position, he could get dizzy and pass out.

He also started to notice signs of osteoporosis, but did not realize they indicated demineralization,
caused by his diet high in fruits.

Aajonus felt euphoric most of the time, but didn’t realize that his extreme highs were mania caused
by excessive fruit consumption.
He was easily tired and prone to anger.

As a fruitarian, his pulse rate averaged 62, his blood pressure averaged 107/70, and his body
temperature 96.8 °F.
Ejaculation was pleasurable but draining. Frequent ejaculation would make him depressed, anxious,
irritable.

Ate 27, Aajonus also did a 31 days water fast. It took him 2.5 years to recover from it.


Aajonus told his father that if he stopped eating salt, his migraines would stop, but he didn’t listen at
the time.

Aajonus had a date with Twiggy, who he said was the model that started the skinny trend.

Aajonus’ publicity agent, at the head of MGM Publicity, asked him to take her on a date.
They went to the theater in a limo, in Avco Cinema 3 that was just built in Westwood, one of the
first multi-theaters in LA.

The driver told her she had a cute face, but wasn’t Marilyn Monroe, which made her mad.

After the movie, since Aajonus was sick, he didn’t want to face the cameras. They left through the
back, but since the theater wasn’t fully finished, they got stuck. She screamed for five minutes, until
he tested the door and found it was open.

Aajonus would have other similar experiences with thin people, and later attribute some of that
over-emotionality to a lack of body-fat. Very thin people have no fat to buffer the electromagnetic
energy that goes through the nervous system.

Aajonus first learned about the benefits of raw, unheated honey from a military medical doctor in
Central America (probably during his initial travel there, but it could have been later in his life),
who observed that wounds healed 3-5 times faster with unheated honey applied to them.

Later, his experimentation with unheated honey, used topical and ingested, on humans and animals,
would confirm this.

1973 — 27th year

Aajonus fell down from 160 pounds to 98 pounds, but starting eating 10 avocados a day to regain
weight, and reached 113-118 pounds.

Aajonus felt noble about following a vegan diet, but although his health initially improved on it, it
started deteriorating again, despite following the complete protein rules.

Within two years of becoming a fruitarian, Aajonus’ teeth started to decay.
He thought it was a temporary detoxification.

## Changing Names

1975 — 29th year

Aajonus didn’t like his names John and Richard, also nicknamed Dick.

In 1975, during a reading exercise with children, the letters of his name “John” were brought
together into “Aja” and “Aura”, which became “Aajonus”.


Aajonus liked the Greco-Roman ring to the name, and kept it.

He changed his last name from “Swigart” to “Vonderplanitz”, which he said was the name of some
of his ancestors.
He found that they were of Russian origin, orators and judges to the czars of Russia and Prussia,
who had over time migrated from Russian, to Germany, to Brooklyn.
The name would indicate that his Vonderplanitz ancestors founded the town Planitz, near Zwickau,
in Germany.

Aajonus described his family’s history as follows:
“My family on my father's side were very wealthy. Judges and very wealthy people. The
Vonderplanitz in Germany are high political. My cousin Bernard was the Consul General of
Germany to the United States. Also my great uncle was President Garfield. He pissed some people
off. And of course just like Kennedy, he got killed three months in office. So they had enough
wealth that when my grandfather and grandmother on my father's side got married, Judge Anson
went to England and bought some of the queen's herd. And these were phenomenal animals. The
only ones in America like it.”

## Death and Rebirth

1976 — 30th year

Aajonus’ blood and bone cancer resurged.
He felt pain and extreme cold in every bone and joint of his body when the temperatures went
below 28 °C / 50°F. Below 48 °F, he was crippled and in excruciating pain, unable to move.

He couldn’t bicycle anymore and started hopping freight cars.

Aajonus was nearly 30 and didn’t want to go through this pain anymore.

He chose to die.

He picked an old Native American burial site at the foothills of St. Martinus Mountain Range, a
Southern desert in Thermal, California, and began fasting, waiting for death.
He knew it could take more than 60 days to die from fasting.

He was drinking water to keep the headaches away.

Days went by.

A den of coyotes lived up the foothills of the part of the mountain Aajonus had picked.
For around 10 or 12 days (it was harder for Aajonus to recollect the timing due to his mind feeling
hazy from the fasting), they would come every night, at midnight, howling in a way that to Aajonus
sounded like sounds crazy people make, and playing with him.

There were 11 of them.

One day, the coyotes brought him a jackrabbit they had freshly killed and ripped open.


It was laying at his feet, warm, squishy.

Aajonus had a thought, he remembered what his uncle had told him and his cousins as children, that
eating a rabbit raw could infect your digestive system, and kill you painfully in 2 days.

He thought the coyotes wanted to help him die faster.

He had already gone through years of extremely suffering, so he could take 2 days of suffering.
He wanted his death to come faster than by fasting for weeks, so he ate it.

It was September of 1976.
It was the first time, after 6.5 years of fruitarianism, that he was eating meat.

The first few bites were difficult, and he vomited.

He felt bad for eating a rabbit, which reminded him of the Easter bunny.

It took him 5 minutes to motivate himself to continue eating.
He would manage it the same way he did the vegetables his mother made him eat and that he hated.

The more bites he took, the better it tasted. By the 12th or 15th bite, it tasted incredibly good.
He ate around 3.5 pounds of the 7 pound rabbit.
The coyotes ate the rest, and left.

He returned to his campsite.

He thought he was already starting to die as he was feeling good on his way back, euphoric, calm,
and happy.


He thought he was leaving with body, just like in his 3 near-death experiences, where there was no
pain.

He laid down in his sleeping bag, expecting severe stomach cramps that he was warned about.

Instead, he woke up the next morning, having had the first completely restful sleep of his life.

He didn’t even feel as cold as usual.
It would take him 2 hours of sun shining on his sleeping bag before he could get out of it, but this
time, he did it in 45 minutes, stayed naked in the sun for 10 minutes.

The energy carried on for three days, with his pain reduced by 60%.
He did not experience any diarrhea, or vomit, or any other symptom.

He realized the tribes weren’t lying to him when they told him to eat raw meat.

He began eating meat almost daily, at least three times a week.

He travelled on his bicycle again.

He started hunting, trapping birds, chipmunks, rattlesnakes, scorpions, tarantulas.
He ate anything he could capture, and would just break off the poison gland from venomous
animals.

After a couple weeks, he felt he wasn’t getting enough food, and was 96 pounds.

He went to local farms.
He was in a country with plenty of farmland, mostly for dates and citrus, but also pigs, goats, cows.
He made deals with three farms to work, milking the animals, shovelling manure, in exchange for
raw rabbit, chickens, eggs, dairy, all he could get.

He was drinking a gallon of raw milk a day, eating between a quarter to half a pound of raw butter a
day.

2 months after eating raw meat, Aajonus’ shoulders and chest bones finally started to develop.

In 2.5 months, he went up to 150 pounds.
He felt stronger than ever.

His angina was gone ever since he started eating raw meat.

He began to jog, then run up to 13 miles, did 250 push-ups with his feet 2-3 feet off the ground, and
30 handstand push-ups every day for 1 year.

He looked like a “scaled” Arnold Schwarzenegger.
That was the first first time in his life that he had muscles.

Aajonus had been so weak all his life that he now felt invincible.

He went back to Los Angeles to share his discovery, raw meat was the answer.


People told him he was crazy, would get a brain fluke and become an idiot, to which he would reply
that he had already been an idiot for 22 years of his life, and that he would continue eating raw meat
until it stops working for him, or somebody would prove him otherwise.

People told him he looked extremely healthy.

He was hired by a major health food store in Los Angeles to manage their nutritional department.
At the time, health food stores didn’t sell meat.
He suggested to people to eat raw meat, and those who tried always had significant health
improvements.

His positive results always outweighed the negative ones.
After discovering the benefits of raw fat, his successes with diseases reached 60%.
After discovering the benefits of raw meat, they reached 75%.
After finding out the specific amounts and foods required, they reached 85% or more, depending on
the disease.

At the time, there was nothing like the Primal Diet that Aajonus was progressively elaborating.

Some healing was immediate, but would often require more time to detoxify and regenerate.

Aajonus experimented again with supplements.
He realized within 6 months that they were toxic, at least on a raw diet.

The more he consumed, the worse he got.
They destroyed Aajonus’ desire and ability to exercise.

Over 2 years, he observed through people’s iris and condition that people who took a lot of vitamin
supplements developed toxic livers and glands.

However, they wouldn’t stop the supplements because they felt a high from it.
Aajonus’ interpretation was that those highs were from an emergency reaction to toxicity, the liver
sending out hormones calling forth glycogen to handle the toxicity, similarly to coffee and
cigarettes.

Aajonus hired Kevin Peter Hall, who would then play in Harry and the Hendersons, and the alien in
Predator, in the health food store.
He was over 7 feet tall and had to crouch to go through the door. His height was perfect to reach the
plants once a week without having to use a ladder.

Kevin was from a tribe that eats raw red meat and raw dairy, as well as blood three months a year.

In 1976, there was a swine flu vaccination campaign.

Aajonus did a radio show with Ida Honorof, who was a consumer advocate syndicated nationwide
on 3000 radio networks, and who proved with Dr. Eleanor McBean that the swine flu was a hoax,


and that the swine flu vaccine was going to harm, even kill, many people. She put forward figures
where 2300 elderly people died within two weeks after getting the shot.

1977 — 31st year

In 1977, Aajonus started getting fat.
He stayed as fat as possible for 20 years.

Aajonus met Owanza di Mdina when when she was around 28 years old.

She had 63 tumors, 16 in her liver; 30 in her spine; four in her uterus the size of woman’s fist, and
was given three days to live.

She was allergic to everything, including water. She could only drink grapefruit juice.

She had been vegan for 14 to 18 years.

With Aajonus’ help, she would gradually get better, although she could vomit up to 11 times a day.

They became colleagues and lovers. Owanza is credited for several discoveries that are part of the
Primal Diet.

1979 — 33rd year

Aajonus’ health kept improving since eating raw meat, but because of everyone warning him for
three years about it, he was only eating meat two to three times a week, usually fish or chicken,
always with a fear in the back of his mind that one day, a bacteria or parasite could harm him.

The first time that Aajonus had proof of the validity of iridology was around 1979.

He was kissing his girlfriend, looked in the eyes, and saw a blood spot around the uterus area
mapped in the iris.

He asked her if she was bleeding. She confirmed she was spotting.
It wasn’t her period though.
He then told her that she had a tear in her uterus, according to iridology.
She told him she had an intra-uterine device.

This was one of the only types of situation where Aajonus would use the help of the medical, a
mechanical job.

Aajonus brought her to the hospital, and the IUD had indeed punctured her uterine wall, and was in
her gut.
He asked the hospital to remove the IUD. They wanted to remove the uterus and ovaries as well, but
Aajonus told them they would come back if there was an infection.
They accepted, and removed the device. No complications followed.


1980 — 34th year

Aajonus completed approximately 75 fasts from 1969 to 1980, of various kinds.
Some were 1-day weekly fasts, others lasted 5 to 41 days.

During 60% of them he only drank water.
During 40% of them, including his 41-day one, he drank his urine and a little water.

Each fast, including the 1-day ones, was difficult.

The easier of the long-term fasts was the 41-day one, because of drinking his urine which contains
nutrients, the blood with the red blood cells removed by the addition of ammonia released the
kidneys.

It still took Aajonus 1.5 years to recover from it.

Fasting for longer than 3 days was impossible for him without wash away the toxins in the bowels
through enemas, without which he had constant headaches, depression, anxiety and nausea.

However, the enemas had the major downside of destroying very important digestive bacteria.

Aajonus stopped fasting that year when he realized its downsides outweighed its benefits.

One time, after a fast that took place at an unknown date, Aajonus was starving, but didn’t have any
meat left.
It was a Sunday morning, so no stores were open.

He had a bad headache, and his hunger was such that he went into a garbage can behind a fish
market, found salmon in it, and started eating it.

He noticed that the salmon was undulating with white parasites. He was so hungry that he kept
eating anyway.

For 10 weeks afterwards, Aajonus had his blood and feces tested, and there was no signs of
parasites in them.

## Deadly Poisoning

1981 — 35th year

In 1981, Aajonus misidentified a poisonous mushroom and ate it.

At the time, he was living on Jekyll Island, Georgia, where his parents had their retirement home.

He and his girlfriend, Owanza, were walking to the beach.

They noticed beautiful mushrooms growing in someone’s yard.
Aajonus checked that there was no cup at the bottom to rule out that it would be a toxic type of
Amanita mushroom.


He picked one that was large, around 3.5 inches in diameter, and they both ate it on their way to the
beach.

He was fine in the moment.
Owanza vomited 2 hours afterwards, multiple times. Vomiting was common for her, as she had had
terminal cancer.
Aajonus also started vomited hours later.

They went back to the place where they had found the mushroom, and this time, Aajonus noticed
the mushroom was malformed, probably because of pesticides or other chemicals that were used on
the lawn.

The cup was not visible at the base, but almost two inches underground.

The mushroom was actually the Amanita Phalloides, or Death Cap, the deadliest mushroom.
Aajonus had just eaten 15 times the lethal dose for a person his size.

Owanza was saved by the food she had eaten before which allowed her to swiftly vomit the
mushroom.
Aajonus hadn’t eaten anything before the mushroom.

He started getting spams and cramping in all his muscles. Only his heart wasn’t cramping.

The pain would make him pass out after 20 minutes of those.

Then, for 20 minutes, he would get nothing, unless he started moving anything below his torso, as
little as a toe.

Aajonus forced himself to eat one to two pounds of raw butter daily to prevent his liver getting
completely destroyed.

Because the liver is like the heart, mostly protein with little fat, it lacks protection, which is mainly
provided by fat. Aajonus made sure his body was filled with fat at all times.

He ate raw fish and honey which helped lower the pain.

He ate meat three times a week.

He ate high potassium foods, like banana (together with raw butter), to remove the lactic acid that
cause muscle cramps.

Still, 90% of his liver got destroyed.

Aajonus’ cancers returned, with twice worse symptoms than he ever had.

His teeth started decaying again.

His diabetes returned.

His skin became extremely thin.
He couldn’t be barefoot anymore.


Abscesses were constantly developing.

He experienced severe liver pain and muscle cramps.

He underwent extreme weight loss.

It was recorded that anyone eating the death cap would die within 10 days, in extreme pain.

Although Aajonus was a semi-invalid again, he didn’t die.
No one was known to have survived from eating only 1/15th of the amount he had.

The pain could continuously last for a month.

These symptoms lasted 10.5 weeks before getting better.

During this time, Aajonus also swam in lakes full of alligators, every day for 18 months.

His need to swim in the lake was such that he was fine with the risk of dying.
The water was farm and full of algae.

He never got bit by them.
The first time, he was afraid. When he got into the lake, many alligators from the side joined him.
They were 9 feet to 14 feet long. Aajonus saw their eyes and nose up close.

Sometimes they would suddenly dive, and go 20 feet under, then 10 feet.
A female alligator got closer to Aajonus over 6 months, and would then swim across the lake 3
times with him for a year.

Aajonus did a workshop where he talked of urine therapy, and the various benefits of urine,
including as an antiseptic.
A retired policeman from the Miami Police Department asked to talk, and explained how in his
work, when they found somebody who was bleeding, they were told to pee in a cup and pour it on
the injury to stop the bleeding in 1 or 2 minutes. That was until 1928, where they were told not to
do that anymore. Since then, they had to watch hundreds of people bleed to death.

Aajonus recommended a diet to Judy Mazel, who then turned it into a book called The Beverly
Hills Diet, which became a best-seller.
However, that diet was specific for her to lose weight, and harmful to the nervous system if done for
more than a couple days.

1982 — 36th year

For a year and a half, the healing was slow.

Aajonus lost three wisdom teeth and one molar.


## Healing Breakthrough

Aajonus started eating meat daily, and twice daily, in December 1982.
He ate beef, lamb, buffalo, seafood and organically grown fowl.

The pain improved substantially, his diabetes symptoms stopped.
His healing doubled, or tripled.

In 4 months with this regimen he healed as much as he had done before in 1.5 years.

By December 1982, the Primal Diet was 70% developed.

Aajonus was still underestimating the damage from too much high-carbohydrate foods, like fruits,
and cooked starch.

Aajonus loved high-carbohydrate fruits, and ate a lot of them.

He noticed he could become too emotional, hyperactive or manic within 90 minutes of eating them.
He used to think those states were high energy, but the issue is that he couldn’t control them
enough.

Reducing his high-carb fruit consumption from 30% to 5% of his diet, and eliminating high-carb
juices entirely, significantly improved his clarity, focus, and composure, even during stress.
By 2002, the results on hundred of people would validate these findings.

Aajonus had avoided to eat a predominantly animal-based diet, thinking he would get sluggish
because of the micronutrient-deficient feed given the farm animals.

When he did, he experienced the negative side-effect he had foreseen.
His cravings for high-carb fruits increased.

To avoid consuming high amounts of fruits, he started drinking a quart a day of raw vegetable juice,
mainly celery, which provided the extra micronutrients (enzymes, vitamins, and minerals) without
the sugar, correcting the imbalance from the animal-based diet while avoiding fruit cravings.

He divided the juice in up to 5 or 6 portions, often adding 1oz of raw cream, raw milk, or raw
coconut cream to each, separated raw meat and raw vegetable juice consumption by 1h, because of
their opposite requirements in digestive environments.

He would cycle raw juice, then raw meat, raw juice, ... with raw fats eaten along with both.

In “Primal Diet”, The word “primal” does not refer to a temporal idea, the past, in the sense of
cavemen or paleo diet, but to the idea of the basic requirements of the body.

Aajonus wasn’t even certain that what long-term ancestors supposedly ate was scientifically proven.


1983 — 37th year

Aajonus was featured in Disney’s EPCOT Magazine in an episode titled “You Are What You Eat”.

Aajonus’ father started getting arrhythmia, which is irregular heartbeat.
Aajonus told him to not worry about it, but to stop eating salt.
12 years after Aajonus had first told him, he stopped eating salt, and his migraines stopped.

1985 — 39th year

Aajonus mentioned it took him 2.5 years to recover from the mushroom poisoning after he started
eating raw meat twice daily (in December 1982), which would be in 1985.

Aajonus said he was “completely recovered” fully by then, but then precised that although he had
reached a decent state, it would take a couple more years to fully recover.

## Fixing Depression

For 3.5 years after his mushroom poisoning, Aajonus was depressed.

He wanted to kill himself, and found a way which wouldn’t contaminate the earth by poisoning or
shooting himself.
He taped a plastic bag around his head and went to sleep.

He woke up feeling terrific and his depression was gone.
The bag had come slightly loose during his sleep, allowing him to breathe.

He realized that people could be breathing too much oxygen and that some carbon dioxide could be
healthful.
When people have panic attacks, they are told to breathe in a plastic bag.

## Saving his Son

1986 — 40th year

On September 1986, at 22 years old, Aajonus’ son Jeff had a life-threatening car accident.

He ran into a tree at high speed and was propelled through the window, and fell into a coma.
4/5 of his brain got damaged.

1987 — 41st year

The team of neuro-specialists said Jeff would never come out of coma, and would die.

Aajonus learned of Jeff’s condition, and went to the hospital to feed him raw foods in secret.


That’s the story told in the first volume “Out of the Grips of Disease and Death (the story)” of
Aajonus’ first book We Want To Live (first published in 1997), which takes place in April 1987.

Aajonus made a mixture of half raw unsalted butter, half unheated honey, and fed it to Jeff by
placing it under his tongue.

In 24h, Jeff was already out of the coma.

Aajonus then fed Jeff ground raw meat, beef and fish, mixed with honey.

In 12 days, he got out of intensive care and was in rehab.

In August 1987, Jeff had recovered from his accident.

The doctors claimed that if he ever survived, which they thought was impossible, he would be
mentally handicapped.

Jeff went back to live in Cincinnati and finished college.

Because of social pressure, he didn’t keep eating raw meat frequently, but mostly when getting sick,
fatigued or depressed. He kept eating raw eggs consistently.
When meeting with Aajonus, though, he would eat 99% raw and feel better.

Jeff developed a crack addiction after the accident.
He had taken Ritalin as a child, and 86% of the people who are addicted to crack took this drug as
children.

Aajonus mentioned it took him 6.5 years to recover to a balanced state from the mushroom
poisoning (which was in 1981). This seems to conflict with some of his other statements which
would have him fully healed by 1985, so both will be left.

For the third time, his cancers, that had re-emerged, were in remission.

## Legal Career Beginnings

1988 — 42nd year

Aajonus had experience with 300 to 500 patients at this time.

From 1988 to 1995, Aajonus went to Venice Beach daily, setting up a table, to try to get people to
follow his diet.
He wanted to see what the results would be on thousands of people.

He talked to around 10,000 people, and got about 3,200 to try the diet and report results back to
him. They didn’t disappoint.

The police started preventing the runaway teenagers who were painting portraits for a living, and
were conducting other such businesses, from operating there.


These people often had a past of abuse or sexual abuse, and preventing them from working was
pushing them into prostitution or drug trade.
Aajonus, and Jerry Rubin, a famous activist, got the help of attorneys, and printed documents to
help those people, explaining to them that the police officers were infringing on their civil rights,
and offering them the services of their attorneys if necessary.
They did this for 5.5 years.

The police hated Aajonus, and set him up by getting someone to attack him.
Aajonus beat his opponent with a stick, and was arrested for assault and battery.
The seven witnesses got arrested, including Jingles (a nickname which may have referred to Harry
Perry), and Jerry Rubin.

Aajonus sued the Los Angeles Police Department and the city, representing himself.
He took them through 5 years of legal proceedings.

He was the only layperson who got them into federal court.

For 22 days, he had to question over 20 officers, among which there were lieutenants, captains and
sergeants.

He was sleeping only one and a half hour every day, 10 minutes at a time, and had to stand up for
hours during the trials.

To withstand this rhythm, he had to eat small amounts of food frequently, avoiding big meals that
would be harder to digest. He ate just enough to have energy but never to full satiety. He would eat
a raw egg, or a small amount of raw meat, every 45 minutes to 1 hour.

He managed to get his raw foods into the courtroom by presenting a motion citing he was diagnosed
with diabetes.

A juror was swapped with a juror that had been working with the police department for 10 years.
There are no records of her being in the jury. The other three jurors told Aajonus that she prevented
them from ruling in his favor.

The trial was fraudulent.

Aajonus didn’t win, but cost them millions of dollars.
During the 7 years this was taking place, the police didn’t bother the runaways.

## Letting Go of Medical Myths

1989 — 43rd year

Since he came back to society after first eating raw meat, the social pressure, worsened by Aajonus’
particular condition of not being able to secrete hydrochloric acid, made him worried about the risk
of a microbial infection for 13 years.

His main fear was of parasites infesting his brain and making him mentally impaired again.

In 1989, Aajonus finally realized that this was probably a myth.


He went to five of the main medical universities and looked for experiments proving that raw meat
gives parasites, but there wasn’t any.
He asked every nutritional and medical professor at those universities, talking to over 60 people.

He felt angry that the medical world would say of him that he is not credible, when he now
considered them the least credible people of all.

Aajonus would then find that the FDA's reports of bacterial illness (24-81 million cases a year)
stated that over 96% were from cooked foods, such as canned foods.

Aajonus’ life became even more enjoyable and relaxed after he realized nature is not as hostile to
human beings as depicted by health departments, and that the interactions with microbes, including
those considered pathogenic, are harmless, and even symbiotic.

One of Aajonus’ laboratory experiment that year showed that when people eat supermarket quality
raw meat, tests of their stools show the fats containing toxins leave almost unchanged and
undigested with the same concentration of toxins that they initially had, indicating that when fat is
eaten raw, the body can avoid absorbing most toxins from it.

When he experimented with magnets from 1989 to 1992, he found they could be beneficial.
Aajonus bought a $1,000 Nikken magnetic mattress, but found out that they didn’t follow their own
specifications.
The magnets’ poles were alternated, but in line instead of being in spirals.
So he moved them in spirals, and for 5 months, he felt good, but started feeling horrible afterwards.
For people on raw diets, at least, temporary use of magnets could be beneficial.

In the 1980s

Aajonus discovered the nature of cancer during laboratory work in the 1980s.
According to him, cancer is the inability to discard dead cells. Tumorous cells are not pathogenic,
they are merely tombs the body creates on purpose to hold off dead cells until the body finds a way
to get rid of them.

Aajonus experimented with feeding distilled water to animals.
Over 2 years, they developed some osteoporosis, fragile tissue, and general edema.
After placing one group on raw milk, and the other on mineral water, both groups healed, but the
one on raw milk healed 3x faster.

Aajonus discovered through autopsies that the appendix contains all the bacteria and chemicals that
ever entered the body, and how to react to them.
When a particular chemical is already registered (for example, the body was already exposed to a
certain venom), the body can react very rapidly, in 20 to 40 minutes, to the contamination.
Without the appendix, it can take 24 to 42 hours for the body to react, as it needs to analyze the
threat each time.


Aajonus mentioned an anecdote taking place at an unknown date.
His grandmother was Jewish and followed the Kosher rules, so when Aajonus ate butter and meat
together at her place, she, and the rabbi, who was also present, got upset.
He explained that he was eating this way because he had allergies, and both the grandma and the
rabbi told him to keep doing what worked for him if he had to.

## Meeting his Future Publisher

1990 — 44th year

Paul Kruhm, who would later become Aajonus’ publisher, met Aajonus in 1990.
Aajonus was nonchalantly eating raw meat and introduced Paul to his paradigm.
They were room-mates.

Aajonus told Paul he wanted to make a movie, called We Want To Live.
Paul suggested he could write a book instead, which Aajonus would end up doing.

Paul later said he saw Aajonus as a father figure.

Aajonus did not investigate any charities since 1990.

When he was investigating food charities, he discovered that they were actually ways for companies
like Purina, General Foods and General Mills to resell millions of dollars worth of products that did
not pass inspection.

Aajonus has experimented with EMF-protecting devices since 1990, and found that some of them
reduced EMF by half a milligauss, which is not a lot, but could be useful.
Aajonus used one in his cellphone.

1991 — 45th year

In 1991, Aajonus backpacked in Hawaii through Waipo Valley.
He took a quart of a mixture of 2/3 raw unsalted butter, 1/3 unheated honey. This gave him energy
for his trip.
He packed towels around the jars so that they wouldn’t break, and wrapped all in bags in case they
did.

Aajonus did a laboratory test to find the difference between a fat molecule from cooked fat and
from raw fat.

The test was supposed to cost $8,000 but ended up costing $23,000 to develop.
The test would then cost $6,000 per person;

This allowed Aajonus to prove that a high level of cholesterol in the blood could be due to old
cholesterol made from cooked fat being replaced by the body by new cholesterol made from raw
fat.


1992 — 46th year

In 1992, Aajonus felt like he had reached a good level of mastery over iridology, his own
interpretation of the discipline that he developed from his own observations.

11 years after his mushroom poisoning, Aajonus had fully recovered, reaching a state equivalent to
the one he was in prior to the poisoning.

Aajonus’ success rate with cancer was of 95% at that time.

He was invited on the show of Mo Gaffney, a famous comedian.

The set was a nice dinner table with candelabras, with silver platters.
Aajonus had a raw chicken under his, while she had a pizza.
Aajonus’ story was told, then Aajonus was asked to prove that he was eating raw meat.

The chef reveals the plate, acting in a comedic way.
There were no utensils, so Aajonus took the leg, ripped it off, and started eating it.
The audience reacted, Aajonus offered them some, then kept talking with the host, and the audience
calmed down.

Aajonus considered this show he best he was invited on, and praised its handling.

## Studying in Paris

1993 — 47th year

Aajonus lived in Paris and studied at the Sorbonne Institute between 1993 and 1996 for 3 months a
year.

He wanted to read Pasteur’s works.
He could read some French, but didn’t understand all the terms, so he had someone help him
translate.
The papers said that not one of the animals Pasteur vaccinated survived.

Aajonus was eating meat from the Carrefour supermarket.

The only way to get raw dairy was to go to farms or outdoors markets 50 miles out of Paris.
Because Aajonus kept asking for it, the supermarkets also started selling the raw dairy.

The raw dairy was often sour and bitter, which was considered normal.

Aajonus was also at the British American Drama Academy in Stanford.


Richard Dreyfuss once told Aajonus that he was eating all these raw foods for nothing. He replied
that he was at least not depressed, unlike him.

Around that time, Aajonus started writing drafts for a future book.

## Saving his Mother

Aajonus’ mother called him and told him she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

She had a lumpectomy, removing 11 glands, and radiation therapy.
The doctors had lied to her by telling her the radiation therapy was pinpoint, and although Aajonus
warned her that they didn’t have this technology, she believed them.

She was on oxygen for 7 years.

Aajonus threatened the doctor, telling him that if he ever touched his mother again, he had friends
who would ruin his life.
The doctor stopped taking calls from the mother, pretending he was retiring.

Another doctor then put a hearing aid in her brain, and gave her antibiotics for 6 months, for no
reason.

One week of antibiotics destroys 1% of the body’s bacteria, and the body’s function, such as in the
gut, relies 90% on bacteria, according to Aajonus.

She could not digest food anymore and stopped eating.

His younger brother called him and told him that she was going to die in 24 to 48 hours.

Aajonus brought one of his formulas, a papaya custard that was a mixture of raw unsalted butter,
unheated honey, raw egg, and papaya.
He gave it to her as soon as he arrived, at 7:30 in the morning, and she loved it.
She threw her other food away and had four meals that day.

Aajonus was upset at his brothers and father, and got rought with them.
He asked them why they waited for her to get to this shape before calling him, knowing he had the
answers.

Aajonus kept giving her half a cup of papaya every morning, and would give her the full custard
once every 10 days.

She was now eating 3 meals a day, and gaining weight.

He gave his family instructions.
For 6 weeks, they fed her the papaya, then they stopped doing it, and she stopped eating again.
Aajonus insisted.

It took 6 months for her to recover with raw papaya and low-quality cooked foods.


## The Health Impacts of EMF

1994 — 48th year

Aajonus moved into a new house, which was old, in Venice, Los Angeles, near the beach.

He bought a laptop, and started getting carpal tunnel symptoms, pain in his joints and muscles of his
hands, one week after starting using it, for 12 days.
It was going into his elbow and shoulder, and felt his bone cancer resurging.

Aajonus thought there could be radons in the house.

He searched through the Yellow Pages and called an environmental specialist, who measured his
house for EMF, and found the laptop emitted massive amounts of EMF.

So Aajonus bought a wired keyboard and mouse, kept the laptop at a distance, and stopped getting
the symptoms in 24 hours.

Aajonus bought the EMF meter, a TriField Meter, from the specialist.

He later used the EMF meter to test every car he was considering, settling for a Toyota Prius that
read from four to eight gauss when standing still, and thirteen gauss when moving.

Aajonus later made a magnetic pillow to limit his exposure to EMF.

1995 — 49th year

It took Aajonus until 1995 for the fat on his body to look significantly more compact than fat made
from cooked foods.

At this point, he looked lighter than he was.
He could have protective fat on his system, to protect him from internal and environmental toxicity,
while looking trim.

## The End of the French Life, and Mad Cow Disease

1996 — 50th year

Aajonus’ girlfriend told him that they had to marry or they would break up.

They broke up, and Aajonus went back to the USA.

On his way back, in the plane, Aajonus read a magazine that talked about how the Carrefour
supermarkte had been supplied with mad cow disease meat for years. It’s what he had been eating
for all those years in France.

However, he had no issues. The incubation period was supposed to be of 10 to 12 years, but after
those years passed, Aajonus was still fine, with no prion disease.


It was because he was eating mostly lean cuts, and toxicity stores in fats and glands.
People who ate brains, especially cooked, were much more likely to get poisoned by the cows who
had mad cow disease.
The mad cow toxicity was caused by dewormers, and not by the animal flour itself, according to
Aajonus. The heavy metals would poison the spinal cord, and damage the brains of the cows.

## Lime and Lemon Juice in Mo’orea

Aajonus went to the island of Mo’orea, between Bora Bora and Tahiti.

Aajonus didn’t like Tahiti very much, because he thought the people there were trying to be like
white people while hating white people.

He saw Mo’orea as a more authentic native place.
It has a high mountain, many waterfalls, some steep roads on which he bicycled.

Aajonus went snorkeling early in the day, and thought he had 6 to 7 hours before the tide would
come in.
However, he stayed 11 hours there without noticing, until he realized the danger.
There was a 20-foot reef in his way he had to get through.
He spent 15-20 minutes counting the waves, to time it so he could get through the reef quickly.
He got through but towards the end some coral injured his thigh.
He hadn’t had an accident since 1993, which was just a twisted ankle.
Although he had heard stories of people getting gangrene and losing their legs 48 to 72h after
getting injured by coral, he believed it was a myth and didn’t worry much about it.
He was expecting to heal fast thanks to his raw meat diet.

He stopped at a restaurant which was just the owner’s house with a table in the yard.

The girl who came to take Aajonus’ order, and was probably around 16 years old, noticed Aajonus’
injury. She asked him if he got this injury from the coral.
Aajonus didn’t notice his injury was below his shorts and visible, there was pus coming from it.
She told him to wait, but Aajonus asked her if she could take his order first.

He ordered ceviche. She said they had good bird from that day.

She brought Aajonus his order and half a lime.

She told him to squeeze the lime juice on his injury and rub that for about a minute, like a mother
lecturing her son.
In 20 minutes, the infection had stopped.

Aajonus ate his ceviche. He had eaten raw chicken before, but never prepared like this.

It was marinated in lemon juice and served with diced tomatoes. Aajonus loved it, and loved the
fact that it was normal for the people there to eat it.

By the next morning, the particles that went into his wound came out thanks to the lime juice.


When lime juice is used, the body doesn’t have to use pus, which is white blood cells, to remove
foreign particles.

Aajonus took a used bag from a Norwalk juicer and compared it with an unused bag under an
electronic microscope, finding plastic fibers in the used bag.
The test cost around $6,000.

## Publishing “We Want To Live”

1997 — 51st year

After 28 years of experimentation, Aajonus decided he had enough consistent success, and was
knowledgeable enough, to write a book, which he called “We Want To Live”.

It is almost 300 pages long, and contains two volumes.
The first 125 pages are auto-biographic, covering the story of how Aajonus saved his son in the
hospital after his car accident, with some other anecdotes.
The second volume, Healthfully, is an index of over 200 diseases and the remedies for them.

Aajonus only included remedies if they were proven to have worked on at least 85% of the people
who had tried them. Aajonus had experience with other 3000 people by that time.
Only things he had experimented with and seen to work consistently were included, there was
nothing based on theory alone.

Aajonus’ observations of around 3000 people since 1976 proved that eating raw meat was harmless
and didn’t cause sickness. At most, it could cause an occasional day of diarrhea from liver or
glandular detoxification, a beneficial process.

The publisher of the book was Paul Kruhm.
He was an entrepreneur who published his first film at 25 years old.

He told Aajonus he would never publish his book if he didn’t look as healthy as he did.

Paul’s brother had suffered severe insomnia for 16 years, and doctors couldn’t solve it.
He could not sleep for more than 20 minutes, was antisocial, had ADD, and was suicidal.

Paul found Aajonus’ book manuscript, and sent it to his brother, telling him to try the diet.

After 4 days of eating Aajonus’ raw food remedies, he finally managed to sleep for 5-7 hours.
He slept so well that his family was scared he had committed suicide and broke open his door to
check on him.

His father had spent over 6 figures in doctor bills.
He wrote a check of $75,000 and told Paul to publish Aajonus’ book.

At first, Paul still didn’t believe in bacteria being beneficial, but eventually would agree with that
aspect of Aajonus’ paradigm as well.


Aajonus was part of the Price Pottenger Foundation, just like Sally Fallon was.
According to Aajonus, they preferred his book to hers, Nourishing Traditions, which had come out
2 years earlier, which prompted her to leave the foundation and start her own: the Weston A. Price
Foundation (WAPF).

Aajonus already started working on his second book, the recipe book.

Aajonus contacted several companies that claimed to sell raw coconut oil. Those products would
not ferment.

He asked them to write statements indicating their process and confirming that the coconut never
went above 96 °F.

After 3 months, they admitted the coconut oil/butter was rendered.

The coconut was indeed first cold-pressed, but the pulp was subsequently immersed in high-
temperature water.

Aajonus has been aware of chemtrails since at least 1997.

1998 — 52nd year

In January 1998, Aajonus spoke to a raw vegetarian group in San Francisco.

At the end of his talk, only 4 out of 52 people remained vegetarians.

He told them that of the 1800 people on a vegetarian diet he had met since 1969, only around 4%
did well, only around 0.1% did very well.
“Those who did well were all very athletic with most of their glands overactive, especially thyroid,
adrenals and gonads, with tremendous amounts of innate energy.”

At this point in time, Aajonus ate from ¾ to 3 pounds of raw meat of all kinds daily.

His pulse averaged 70, his blood pressure 127/80, and his body temperature 97.7°F.
The pH of his blood, urine and saliva was 5.5.

His bones no longer easily broke as they did when he was a kid.

He had 5 times more energy and clarity than when he was a fruitarian.

He could have up to 6 hours of sexual activity, with up to 3 ejaculations, daily.
He considered this the best physical feeling, a good stress reliever, and a good balance for the often
pleasureless routines of modern society.


Aajonus used to freeze as a fruitarian, but could now jump into a freezing lake.

5-6 hours of sleep were sufficient for him.

Aajonus hadn’t exercised for 19 years, apart from carrying his groceries, roller-skating once a
month, taking 4 yoga classes, and having regular sex, but was keeping his muscular tone thanks to
the consumption of raw animal proteins and fats, that are not damaged and do not degenerate as
easily.

He didn’t regret any cooked food.
The only unhealthy thing he would have continued to have done if it wasn’t so damaging was to
smoke.

One of the first recorded Q&As from Aajonus is from this year.
He would travel, give a workshop, and reply to people’s questions for hours.

## Teaching Classes

Aajonus was teaching classes in 1998.

One of them was on iridology.
He realized that only half the students could see the patterns and colors as well as he did, which he
attributed to a difference in physical visual abilities.

He was working on a pedagogue for his classes, and stopped them until he would finish it.
[Note: this pedagogue was never published, see https://primal-diet.net/campaign.]

The recipe book was supposed to be completed by the end of 1998, but Aajonus’ political activism
to prevent the ban of raw milk in California and Los Angeles delayed it.

## Founding Right To Choose Healthy Food

The 8th of August 1998, Aajonus started Right To Choose Healthy Food (RTCHF), an organization
(a non-profit trust) whose goal was to protect farmers anytime the health departments and agencies
(USDA, FDA, HHS, ...) tried to outlaw healthy foods, specifically raw foods, usually raw milk and
fresh, raw dairy.

The government started over-regulating raw milk to the point it was almost impossible for it to pass
inspection and would bankrupt the farms.
Big dairy producers like Alta Dena Dairy were losing half of their production and were going
bankrupt.

Aajonus created his trust as a response and started lobbying.


## The Inception of Rawesome Club

Since Aajonus and his network had lost their source of milk, he created a club, with James Stewart
(that would later be named Rawesome by James in 2003), in Venice, Los Angeles.

James handled of the logistics, moving the foods, while Aajonus handled the legal aspect.

They started in a garage that James rented, and Aajonus would send him his patients to get raw
milk. All the members were Aajonus’ patients at the time, but the club would grow massively.

Aajonus would check every supplier, and would strive for bio-eco-organic quality, which is better
than organic quality.

Aajonus could get around raw milk bans by circumventing commerce.

Instead of the farmers selling products to customers, they would sign a contract where the people
interested in getting raw milk were already owners of it through a private membership, and
technically didn’t have to buy it.

Since the FDA only has jurisdiction over commerce, they couldn’t apply their food laws to this
private activity.

Members were the owners of the animals and the land, the farmer wasn’t, and the farmer was only
paid by them to work, for the service of tending to the animals, packaging the foods, etc. that are
already theirs.

The clubs are private and not open to the public.

(These lease agreements were had decades of legal precedents, unlike herdshare that Sally Fallon
and otheres followed which would eventually be more easily attacked in court.)

Aajonus met David Wolfe, a famous vegan, and told him he didn’t have the constitution necessary
like the 8 people Aajonus knew to follow a vegan diet, and that he would hit the wall in 7 years,
which ended up happening.

A German couple who worked for David Wolfe for a year then told Aajonus that David Wolfe
started to eat raw dairy and raw meat in secret, but they weren’t allowed to say it because of a
contract.
He started looking much better.

1999 — 53rd year

In 1999, Aajonus was asked to write an article for Hispaños magazine by one of its editors that he
had known for several years.

The title was "Health or Disease: Do We Have a Choice?".


Aajonus worked 3 days on it, submitted it, and the editor-in-chief refused to publish it because of
how controversial it was.

By that time, many open cavities in Aajonus’ teeth had healed, the teeth regenerating themselves.

Four of the seven crowns he got in 1978 still remained.

His teeth’s appearance was still poor, but they were strong, and strongly attached to the jaw bone?

He only experienced teeth pain during detoxifications that took place every 2 to 3 years, and lasted
3 days at most.

An 8 year old boy, Walker Kehrer, was presented to Aajonus. He had asthma and was frail.

He started drinking raw milk following Aajonus’ recommendation. His asthma healed and his body
properly developed.

He testified in a hearing, saying in his weak, raspy voice, that raw milk was necessary for him and
the only thing that made him feel good.

He later became the number 2 high school tennis champion in the United States.

Aajonus saw a study that supported the idea that too much carbohydrate/sugar consumption was
toxic to the body.

Researchers at Columbia University had found that Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs),
which formed from the body’s usage of sugar, were toxic compounds that stored in the body 70 to
90% of the time.

Aajonus discovered that when the body was making glycogen from raw protein instead, the toxic
byproducts did not store.

## Deer Hunter

In December 1999, one of Aajonus’ friends hunted a deer.

Aajonus butchered it, then blended all the glands and the brain together, and they ate it.

He was tired after having done a workshop and seeing patients for 2 days, and still had to pick up
his girlfriend, Lori, at the airport in Reno, Nevada, which was a 2.5 hours drive late at night.

The gland shake gave him so much energy that his tiredness vanished, and when he picked up his
girlfriend, they had sex for 5 hours, after which Aajonus still couldn’t sleep.

A lot of deer was left, so Aajonus stored it as emergency rations.


Aajonus was against freezing for most foods after seeing through experiments how it damaged
them, so he used another method.

He left the meat a couple hours exposed to the air so the surface would slightly dry out. (Freshly
slaughtered meat is also more moist than most store-bought meat.)
He then put the meat in glass, and added enough peanut oil and olive oil to cover it.

Over 10 years, Aajonus would take out the meat and eat it, it still tasted fresh.

Aajonus didn’t believe in the year 2000 doomsday theories, thanks to his experience as a
programmer.

He thought it was another scam for some people to make money through fearmongering.

1990s

It took 25 years of Aajonus living this way before his father told him in the 1990s:
“I'm proud of you. You are incredible. You don't age, you get younger, and here you get older, and
all I do is be more feeble. I don't know how you do it coming from where you've been.”

In the early 1990s, Aajonus was allowed by a forensic friend of his to do experiments on 8 bodies
during autopsies.

He took their stomach and liver fluids (hydrochloric acid and bile), and put them on different foods
to see how they would react.
There were all kinds of vegetables, fruits, nuts (soft, semi-hard, hard), meats, dairy.
The only foods that broke down from the digestive fluids were the animal products, meat and dairy.

In the late 1990s, Dr. Stanley Bass learned about Aajonus.
He was a hygienist, against eating animal products, but because he had seen people heal
impressively fast with Aajonus’ advice, he started to attend Aajonus’ classes with a critical eye.

He was overweight, almost blind, had cataracts.
He slept during many of Aajonus’ classes.

Over 2 years, he started following Aajonus’ advice, and lost his extra weight, his cataracts healed,
his hair color came back, and his whole life improved.
He then put an interview of Aajonus on his website.

## Raw Milk Victory

2000 — 54th year

In 2000, the Los Angeles county wanted to outlaw raw milk.


There was an intense campaign where much of the media was anti-raw milk, presenting pro-raw
milk advocates, which Aajonus was part of, as food faddists, and quoting doctors without ever
opposing them any arguments.

The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, together with the California State
Department of Health Services and the CDC, made a report claiming raw milk was dangerous.

The report presented 5 cases of illness, or death, attributed to raw milk.

Aajonus investigated and found that none of those had proof that raw milk was responsible for
them.

Some of these conclusions were obtained through biased questionnaires.

For example, one little girl’s death drowned, but her death was attributed to salmonella poisoning
from raw milk. She was the only person in her family who didn’t drink raw milk. But during the
autopsy, since they found salmonella in her gut, they established this loose link with raw milk.

Dr. Nancy Mann, a biostatistician who graduated from UCLA', also rejected the report, saying that
the study had been erroneously conducted and executed.

Aajonus made a report, the Supplemental Report In Favor of Raw Milk, together with Dr. William
Campbell Douglass, Jr, M.D. whom Aajonus described as the world's only medical expert on milk.

In the report, Aajonus cited universities who had practised raw milk therapies for various diseases.
He also cited cases of food contamination from pasteurized dairy products.

The report also presented that certain bacteria deemed pathogenic by those health authorities
actually grew more in pasteurized milk than in raw milk.

Aajonus’ scientific arguments were discarded by the media.
Aajonus contacted the editors, but they refused to acknowledge the report.

When Aajonus published the report, he added a legal notice on the cover that threatened the county
with a class-action lawsuit if they didn’t allow the sale of raw milk.

This forced the authorities to read it, and the hearing took place in March 2000.
They voted 4 to 1 in favor of raw milk.

However, the LA Times did not correct their article, even after this victory.

Aajonus had 99 people present at the hearing.
One of the deputies of the Board of Supervisors told them that for every person that comes to a
government hearing or a rally, they consider that 1000 citizens are represented.

Three other groups used Aajonus’ report to change the laws in their government.
The material used to be available on [https://www.rawmilk.org,](https://www.rawmilk.org,) but the people that inherited Aajonus’ trust
didn’t maintain the website. The articles that were on this website are now on https://aajonus.net/.


That year, Aajonus was contacted by a woman with MS (Multiple Sclerosis) who lived on a gurney
(wheelchair used by hospitals to transport patients).
Besides following his diet, he told her to live in a tropical place, and she went to Mexico City,
where there is more humidity.
3 years afterwards, after following the diet 95%, she could walk again.

## TV Appearances and Hollywood Clients

2001 — 55th year

In 2001, Aajonus was featured in the Ripley’s: Believe it or not TV show, in which he eats months
and years-old raw meat full of bacteria and fungus, which he calls high meat, borrowing the term
from the Inuits.

One of his patients who had long-term psychological problems, and was taking many medications
daily, also tried the high meat, and felt better within 10 to 20 minutes.

The episode aired July 17th and had the most reruns. Aajonus saw it all over the world.

Oprah Winfrey was also going to have him on her show, until she found out at the last minute that it
was about a raw meat diet.

Mel Gibson was one of the few high-profile people who publicly admitted to eating the Primal Diet.

Mel Gibson was not one of Aajonus’ patients but found his book in a health food store.

On the David Letterman show, where he was asked what he was doing to look so great, he said he
was eating raw meat, drinking raw milk, and feeding it to his kids as well.
The tabloids attacked him for a while after he made those statements.
For years he would go on and off the diet, with periods of drinking.

Around 2001 or 2002, Dr. Elnora Van Winkle went on Aajonus’ diet.
She was a neuroscientist from Columbia University, that spent 47 years researching all the
compounds in the brain and the nervous system.
She called 242 of Aajonus’ cancer patients, and found 232 of them were alive, with their cancers
healed. All were over 7 years on the Primal Diet, some over 22 years.
She then said that Aajonus’ results with cancer were statistically valid.

## The Sodium Bomb Military Project

Aajonus’ father worked as an inventor at General Electric.

The US military had tried for over 60 years to try to create a sodium bomb.

They invested 2 billion dollars in General Electric, and his father worked for 6 years on the project.


It failed, because isolated sodium is more volatile than nitroglycerin, and could not stay stable
enough to be made into a bomb.

A football-sized volume of sodium could destroy New York City.

In his work, Aajonus saw that ingesting rock salt had the same effect on a microscopic level.
During digestion, sodium chlorine breaks into isolated sodium which either clumps and produces
magnetisms that rips the guts out of cells when they open up to eat, or explodes and destroys 30 to
50% of nutrients.

However, sodium that is metabolized by plants, and then animals, is bound to a myriad of other
nutrients through different chemical interactions, and does not split in that harmful way when eaten.

Aajonus considered rock salt the second worst culinary practice next to cooking.

2002 — 56th year

In August 2002, the Ripley’s episode aired again.

Since the episode was aired worldwide, a German TV-news program saw it and came to film
Aajonus eating more of the same meat that was now several months older.

## Publishing “The Recipe for Living Without Disease”

Aajonus published his second book, The Recipe for Living Without Disease.

The first 50 pages explain how to follow the Primal Diet and the reasoning behind it.

The next 125 pages are recipes.
There are 82 sauces, entirely made of raw foods, to eat with raw meat, that can be made in 3 to 5
different ways each.
Examples: raw garlic butter, raw barbecue sauce, raw mustard and mayonnaise, ...
These were made in part to help people raw meat, since some people find eating plain raw meat too
foreign.
Another reason was to provide variety for every taste, and so that people could eat more raw meat
without getting bored of it.
There are also desserts like raw cheesecakes.

The last 50 pages focus on the science that validate the Primal Diet.

## Outperforming Famous Athletes

A famous sports physician who worked with many athletic teams was looking into cholesterol
levels in relation to heart disease, at the St. Louis Washington University Medical Center.

He was the cardiac doctor for most of the high-profile athletes, working with basketball teams,
football teams, the whole profession.


He had heard about Aajonus and the Primal Diet, which involves eating massive quantities of butter,
cream, meat, ...

He asked him to bring two people who had been on his diet for at least 5 years, Aajonus brought
him people who had been on it for 20 years.

They were able to perform 20 times more than was expected of them by the physicians.

Aajonus didn’t accept X-rays but accepted ultrasounds.
They searched for 20-25 minutes for congestion in his arteries whereas they usually look for 10-15
minutes, and barely found any. It was a remnant from blockage Aajonus had had ever since his
childhood, which would be broken down over the following years.

They asked Aajonus to do some exercises next. They put electrodes on him.

After running for 5 minutes on the treadmill, his heart rate normalized in 3 minutes.

They put him on a bench press.

They asked him how often he works out. He said not since 1979.
His only exercise was sex, but he hadn’t had a girlfriend for 3 years then.

Aajonus’ didn’t start to strain until the weight reached 190 pounds.

He was then put on the leg press machine.

They went up 20 pounds at a time. Aajonus was getting bored.

He didn’t start straining until 200 pounds, but hid it to see how far he could go, and reached 280
pounds.

His heart rate normalized in 3 minutes. For most people, it would take an hour.

They told him they had never seen such impressive results, even from people who work out three
days per week.

Aajonus accepted one invasive test, a sugar injection. He wanted them to do the test with honey, but
they only had metrics for glucose.
Aajonus hadn’t had since 1972.

It made him shake like if they had given him a gallon of coffee.

For 2.5 hours, they took blood from him every 30 minutes.
He told them that they didn’t need as much blood to do the test, and only needed half a milliliter.

For most people, the glucose would have gone down to 104-110, but it went down to 54.
They had never seen such a healthy pancreas.
It produced a large quantity of insulin, all 4 varieties of them, and some that they hadn’t seen
before.

When his blood sugar level settled, Aajonus felt calm again.


Aajonus told people it was likely the trainer would use raw foods secretly with his athletes to
improve their performance.

Aajonus knew two people with very high cholesterol who were athletic and not overweight.

One of them who was an Olympic competitor in figure skating.
She was fatigued and about to retire, would run out of energy in an hour, but after 6 months on the
Primal Diet, would outperform 16 and 18 years olds. In 2002, she was 31, and also became an actor.

The other was Paul Cohen, the 10-year coach for McEnroe.

On a topic unrelated to cholesterol, another of Aajonus’ athletes was Pem Wall, a martial artist who
started the diet at 55, and at 57, became able to do 12,500 jump ropes at a time, with his heart rate
going down every month when he measured it after exercise.

2003 — 57th year

The government tried to attack two of Aajonus’ farmers in court.
He wrote legal briefs, one 62 pages long, the other 19-pages long, which showed that the
government and the FDA had no jurisdiction over the consumption and exchange of raw milk
between the farmer and the club members under the lease agreement.

Everyone walked out of the courtroom, including the jury.

Aajonus’ request was to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, but the judge didn’t even rule on it.

The farmers were left alone for years after this.

Aajonus was also indirectly responsible for the Dalai Lama eating meat.

The Dalai Lama was sick, and one of Aajonus’ patients was a good friend of his.
He told him he was eating raw meat and raw dairy, and recommended it to him.

Martin Sheen had a severe heart attack in 1992 and refused to receive a bypass surgery.
He started following Aajonus’ diet on and off in 2003, eating raw fats like coconut cream to remove
arterial congestion. Aajonus claimed he started looking better that year.
Charlie was the only one from his family who didn’t do any part of the diet.

## Defending Rawesome

2005 — 58th year

In May 2005, officials came to Aajonus’ Rawesome club.


The Los Angeles County Health Department accused them of selling food without licenses or
permits.

Aajonus sent them a letter reminding them they have no jurisdiction, showing them the contracts,
the membership structure, and confirming that they liked bacteria, especially in their food.

The county dropped the citation.

James Stewart started distributing products that were not raw through Rawesome.
James denied it.
Aajonus had written statements by the producers of these foods that proved the foods were not raw.
James then put a sign indicating the real temperatures at which the foods were heated, but did not
apologize to the members for having misled them for months.

## First Major Accident in Thailand

Aajonus had a car accident in Thailand.
The car flipped over and his head went through the window, he had shards of glass in his skull.
Aajonus broke his collarbone, his clavicle, and two ribs.
The pain was mainly in his arm, making him yell and pass out.

He accepted an X-ray to make sure that his bones didn’t puncture any organ. He only accepted two
while in those situations, they would do 10 to 15.
The doctors said he would never be able to move his arm as freely as before.

Aajonus didn’t get any cast, he just stayed in a wheelchair, and his body developed his own cast.
His arm got swollen and hardened.

It took 4 months to heal.

## The Suspicious Honorary PhD

Aajonus was offered honorary PhDs in nutrition multiple times, by three universities, over the
years.

He refused it from a university in India because he didn’t feel like he needed it, and made it look
like he got a degree from a school instead of having developed his own work.

Another one from England, Richmond University offered him, and he accepted, because they had
no other PhDs in nutrition.

Aajonus was more prone to accept this time, thinking some official credentials could facilitate his
more appearances in the media.
For example, Discovery Channel had scheduled episodes on him 4 times and always cancelled
them, two days before filming. The New York office would cancel it.
He then told me then he had to pay him in advance and they stopped soliciting him.

Aajonus had to be tested on his material to receive his honorary degree, which was unusual.


He received it in August 2005.

However, the diploma didn’t end up helping him, but gave him some issues.

He may have been tricked, since the university the disappeared, and he would then be accused by
some of having used a diploma mill.

Aajonus published revised editions of his two books, the last ones there would be.
[Note: Since Aajonus couldn’t make new editions of the books, important information that he
discovered afterwards are not part of the books.]

## Opening a Website

2006 — 60th year

Aajonus wanted a website. He had used law websites which let the user find legal texts by any
keyword and wanted the same feature for his works.

He contracted the creation of a website in 2006 to Jim Ellingson.
The website is wewant2live.com.
[Note: aajonus.net is now a much more complete and practical version of it.]

## The Gigantic Bladder Stone

In August 2006, Aajonus had an emergency that forced him to use medical help.

When travelling by plane, he noticed that he had a couple of drops of blood when urinating.
A week later, he had to lift his leg like a dog to be able to pee.
It became painful.

An urologist did ultrasounds and X-rays, which revealed he had a massive bladder stone, the
biggest he had ever seen.

The urologist asked if Aajonus did not clear his bladder fully when peeing.
As a child, ever since he had been around 2 years old, Aajonus had trouble urinating. He would take
2 to 3 minutes to start, and the flow would be slow. His mother would get impatient, so he would
hold it in.

Aajonus exceptionally accepted anesthesia for the operation. The doctor thought it would last 35 to
40 minutes, but it lasted two hours to blast the stone to pieces with a laser.
The center of the stone was completely black.

Aajonus asked him to keep the remains of the stone, and analysis showed most of the stone was
thimerosal, a major ingredient of vaccines.

After this, Aajonus could pee “like a horse” which he had never been able to in his life.


The urologist also saw that Aajonus’ urethra hadn’t developed well, which is why he had trouble
urinating as a child.

Aajonus had a bicycle accident in Thailand that broke seven bones in his foot.

He knew a 14 years old girl who loved to crack people’s knuckles.
He asked her to put his bones back in place, instead of asking a doctor.
Afterwards, he bicycled 12 miles and went to see a movie.

Aajonus appeared on Fox News in an early morning segment.
He was supposed to also appear in the evening program, but it was cancelled because he was
speaking of bacteria.

The FDA and Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture cited Amos and Jacob Miller, two Amish
farmers, for selling raw milk without licenses or permits.

Aajonus wrote them a legal brief, showing the government had no jurisdiction, and the health
departments and deputy city attorney walked out of the courtroom.

In December of 2006, the CDC was planning to distribute a pamphlet stating that raw milk is
dangerous.
Aajonus sent a cease and desist order to the FDA and the CDC telling them that if they did, they
would be in violation of integrity and of the constitution.

## Second Major Accident in Thailand

2007 — 61st year

In March 2007, Aajonus had a severe motorcycle accident in Thailand.

He thought his leg was cut off, but it was still there.
The skin had been destroyed and asphalt particles were in the wounds.
His tibia was split in two, his ankle bone was damaged, his sciatica was bruised, and tendons were
ripped off.

A Thai woman helped him get back to his hotel, where Aajonus put lime juice and coconut cream
on his wounds.

Considering the extent of the damage, Aajonus had to know the configuration of the broken bone
pieces. He went to the hospital to get X-rays, but refused any care.
The interns told him he would never walk again if he didn’t attempt a surgery.

Aajonus went back to his hotel and called his girlfriend, who stayed with him all day long for 2
weeks, taking care of him.
The Thai woman also stayed and kept helping Aajonus.


Aajonus cleaned the wounds with lime and coconut cream for two days.
He put slices of meat all around.

Then, all the muscles in his thigh disappeared. His skin was hanging.
The body started developing a hard cast.

Aajonus put his leg in hot water for two weeks.

He ate his “pineapple gati” (“gati” means coconut cream in Thai): ¾ cup of unripe pineapple with ½
cup of coconut cream, ½ of honey, and 1 cup of milk to dissolve the bone fragments in his body.
The pineapple enzymes, which there are more of when it is unripe, are powerful solvents.
He also ate raw unsalted cheese with honey and pineapple. The cheese provided bio-available
minerals to repair the bones and bind to toxic byproducts, while the pineapple provided compounds
that stimulate bone growth.

The tendons grew back in one week.
Within two weeks the natural cast started disappearing.

The Thai woman left, and Aajonus’ girlfriend would stay another month.

At the third week, the leg was healed enough to start moving again. It was still too painful to walk,
so he started swimming to exercise it.
The hotel agreed to lower the chlorine levels of the swimming pool for him.
After 5 days, Aajonus still started getting headaches, earaches, sore throat and sinus problems from
it.
Aajonus started to walk with crutches to go to the ocean instead.

Within 13 weeks, he could walk again, and it took him around a year to fully heal.

Aajonus had three girlfriends in Thailand.
That was due to his high libido that they couldn’t match.
I've got three girlfriends over there. So one at night, sometimes all three on the same day

In 2007, Aajonus published a DVD of a 5.5 hour lecture he had at UCLA the same year.
The workshop explained how the Primal Diet works and how the body functions — from a
nutritional angle — in his view, which differs from the medical profession’s.

At this stage, Aajonus had people who had been following his diet since 1978.

Jim Ellingson revealed that in 2007, Aajonus showed him the blueprint of the clinic Aajonus was
designing in Thailand.

## Lobbying in Washington D.C.

Aajonus, together with 5 people, including the vice president of his trust, used most of the donations
of his trust (around $75,000) to lobby for raw milk for three months, starting from the 15th of June.


The trust rented a town house, and they spent 6 to 16 hours daily, 6 to 7 days weekly, going to 535
offices, every office of all the congresspeople, representatives and senators.

For 2 days, they rewrote Aajonus’ and Dr. Douglass’ “Report In Favor Of Natural (Raw) Milk”, and
had it printed it in spiral notebooks (for about $25k) that they then handled to every office.

Meetings would last 20 to 60 minutes. They educated the congresspeople or their executive staff.

Aajonus was appalled by the answers he got.
The only office that told him outright that he would get a bill if he gave them money was Obama’s.

Ron Paul accepted right away to write a bill with Aajonus.

58 other representatives had told Aajonus that they would co-sponsor a bill if a senator or
representative wrote it, but after Ron Paul did, none respected their word.

James Stewart had an accident where his truck flipped over because somebody cut in front of him.
The arm from his skin was ripped oof.
He refused to go to the hospital, and went home,, applied lime juice, then honey, then meat.
14 days later, his skin was regrown fully.

## Losing the Results of His Laboratory Experiments

Over 11 years, Aajonus had spent a million dollars in laboratory experiments alone.
With inflation factored in, that figure could represent 4 million dollars at the time.

Aajonus tried for years to publish the results of his experiments, but was rejected due to lack of
credentials.

When the owner of the laboratory Aajonus paid for his experiments died, his family asked him
$200,000 for the details of their results.
Aajonus was planning to publish his experiments without those results in his next book, the
detoxification book, which was never published.
[Note: see https://primal-diet.net/campaign for Aajonus’ unpublished data.]

## The Philippines Tribe of 150 Years Old Raw Eaters

2008 — 62nd year

In 2008, Aajonus met a remote tribe in the Philippines that lived up to 150 years old in excellent
health.

Aajonus wanted to meet tribes that still lived in their own ways to see what they were eating, and
how healthy they were.

He knew some tribes like this still existed in the Amazon, but he didn’t want to get lost, and was
more familiar around islands.


The Philippines has 7107 islands, only half of which have been visited by foreigners.

Aajonus knew a producer who was visiting and filming tribes with his crew.
There were tribes in Luzon and Mindanao, the producer was in Luzon, so Aajonus went to
Mindanao.

He was renting a four-bedroom house on the beach of an island for $200 a month.

Aajonus asked the government to give him a permit, telling them he was only a nutritionist who
wanted to observe what they were doing, without interfering with their lifestyle, and wouldn’t take
photos, but they did not accept it.
They were telling him those tribes were cannibals and would eat him.
Aajonus didn’t believe it, he was aware that cannibalism only happened around islands further
down like Borneo. In any case, he still wanted to see for himself.

After three weeks of asking, Aajonus was planning to rent a four-wheel drive and go by himself, so
the government even banned him from renting cars. They didn’t want to take the risk of him dying
while renting one of their cars. Aajonus was mad.

He went to a mall spa to get a massage.

He noticed the receptionist woman was quite dark-skinned for a Filipina, and had a baby behind her
that was so white it looked sickly.
He looked on the desk and saw a picture with her husband, who also had very dark skin.
He thought she maybe had cheated on him. He asked if it was her husband’s baby. She said that it
was and that they even did a test.
The baby was anemic and barely breathing.
The hospital had told her to feed the baby powdered milk in boiled water.
Aajonus explained to her that in Pottenger’s and Howell’s studies, powdered milk gave the worst
diseases to cat, even worse than pasteurized milk did.
He said he would prove it to her.
Aajonus had found a dairy farmer on the island where he was renting, and was buying fresh warm
milk from him. He brought 5 or 6 liters to the woman.
Three days later, the baby was dark skinned, and active.
The grandfather wanted to meet Aajonus.
He was so thankful and offered to do anything he could for Aajonus.
Aajonus told him he was trying to meet a remote tribe.
The man happened to be from a remote tribe that he had left 30 years before, and was now working
for the government as an intermediary between them.
He tried to get Aajonus a permit, but even he couldn’t.
The man still decided to take Aajonus there.

The man’s friend had an all terrain four-wheel drive.
It took them three days to reach the destination.
They drove for 16 hours.
He slept on the beach. They worried about Aajonus because he was sleeping in the rain, but he liked
the warm rain. They weren’t used a man from modern civilization like him being able to live
primitively. They stayed awake in turns to protect him.

The next day, they took a boat for 10h, and had to row to get through certain parts.


On their way, they picked up the man’s cousin that had left the tribe seven years before, and had
visited them twice since.
They then swam over a mile for a day to reach the island. Aajonus wasn’t used to swimming this
much and went a lot on his back.
He was exhausted, and slept for the rest of the day, and the night, when he usually only slept 2.5 to
4 hours per night.

When he met the tribe, the elders wouldn’t let him meet everyone. They didn’t want the rest of the
tribe seeing a white man.
The people who had left the tribe and came back weren’t allowed to talk about it.

He mostly talked to a 82 years old man who Aajonus described as the shaman of the tribe.
The man had perfect teeth, and looked like he was in his early 40s.

3 interpreters were needed, to go from English, to Tagalog, to the language of this tribe.

The tribes only eat two pounds of fresh raw fish and raw mature coconut meat every day, and either
a banana or a mango several times a week.
The men eat a whole coconut while the women eat half of one.
Once in a while, they kill a pig in the forest and eat it raw.
They live on 3 foods only.

Aajonus described them as the strongest, thickest, and healthiest people he ever met.

He was surprised that people could develop such strong bodies on raw fish only.
Aajonus would get hungry fast when eating fish, but this could be explained by the requirements of
his limited health.

To Aajonus, this was the most exhilarating validation of his Primal Diet.

In September 2008, in 36.5 years, Aajonus had eaten 99.999999% of raw foods, and no more than 5
pounds of cooked foods, which were cooked starch (with ample amounts of raw fat).

His height was the same as when he was 18 years old.
His brothers and his father had shrunk 1.5 to 2 inches.

When Aajonus lost weight, his waist was still 30.5 inches, just like when he was 18.
His traits remained thin, from not eating cooked minerals that clutter the body.

## Hacking of the Biohazard Research Folder

Aajonus had spent 22 years collecting data on all types of toxins.

He got hacked and that BIOHAZARD folder, which contained around 2000 pages of research, was
erased from his computer. His other 255 folders were untouched.

He paid a computer firm to try to recover it, but they didn’t succeed.


## Global Warming and Pole Shifts theories

Aajonus was asked about global warming and shared his theories.

He thought that although industrial activity caused massive pollution, and possibly some
temperature changes, the melting of the poles seemed to be caused by a natural, cyclical,
phenomenon.

He said that although he wasn’t an expert in astronomy, he had studied it for 6 years, and believed
that a pole shift happened every 26,840 years.
He cited Albert Einstein and Edgar Cayce as having expressed similar ideas.

Aajonus thought that the North Pole would then shift to central Germany, and the USA’s
environment would become tropical. Water melting from the old Poles would raise the water levels
and flood entire areas, such as everywhere from the Colorado mountains to California.

His estimated date was between 2012 and 2014.

Since Aajonus was facing legal issues in 2012, and died in 2013, he didn’t get to present updates on
these theories.

Because of this risk he was anticipating, and to live in less polluted areas, Aajonus had started
relocating to South East Asia, in particular Thailand and the Philippines.

2009 — 63rd year

In February 2009, Aajonus saw Ron Paul, who had just written and submitted a raw milk bill.

Aajonus stopped the government from shutting down 10 Amish farmers.
Amish people usually avoid involvement with the government, but many listened to Aajonus and
won thanks to him.
When Aajonus was not present, Amish farmers sometimes hired professional lawyers who failed.

The farmers would get raided, with the authorities putting ribbon seals to indicate they are closed.
Aajonus would tell them to wait until the cars left, and tear down the ribbons.
Because the authorities have no jurisdiction, Aajonus would send them notices, telling them they are
liable for felony counts.

Aajonus described his lifestyle at the time.

He was not very active, spending around 16 hours a day on his computer.

A couple times a year, he would become much more physically active while seeing out tribes all
around the world, with having to hike, etc.
During those times, in South East Asia, he would eat up to three pounds of fish a day. He described
the fish there as of very high quality and delicious, so it wasn’t so difficult to do so.


Aajonus used to drink three to four cups of vegetable juice a day, and was now down to 1.5 cup a
day.
Around every 7 years, Aajonus would remove a cup of vegetable juice from his diet, because an
excess could be detrimental to his digestive environment.

From 2004 to 2009, Aajonus found his house and his food each poisoned twice.

1/2 cup of rat poison was put in Aajonus' office chair, under the silk cover.

Each time he sat on it, he felt nauseous and got stomach aches. He developed a 1.6” tumor on the
back of his left hand.

## The Swine Flu Vaccination Campaign

During the 2009 swine flu vaccination campaign, Aajonus was a vocal opposition to it.

He appeared in radio shows, such as the Superhuman Radio, the 28th of April 2009.

During this interview, Aajonus said: “The only way that a human being can get a bird flu or a swine
flu is if it is injected in them.”.

That quote was clipped by Trillion, a rap group in England, who used it a music video called SAY
NO TO THE VACCINE, that got millions of views.

Aajonus reached a new milestone in his opposition to the government.

## Forced Abduction and Life-Threatening Injections

One night, in a hotel in the Philippines, Aajonus was forcefully abducted.

He woke up while men in secret service attire were injecting him with syringes in his shoulder.
They seemed surprised.
His body had been strong enough to wake up, but they immediately put a cloth on his face and he
fainted. It was odorless and instant.

He woke up later, feeling extremely sick, and wondering if it had been a bad dream.
He saw traces of injection in his arm, three large lumps with needle holes, and realized it was real.

He tried sucking it out, but it was too late.

Lumps started appearing on his skin in various areas and started exploding open.
He was passing out every 20 minutes. If he stood up, he would pass out in 3 minutes.

Aajonus suspected he had been injected with 3 swine flu doses.

He called the hotel reception and asked them to arrange a driver as soon as possible.
He told the driver to bring him to the shore.


Aajonus was looking for either shark or stingray that would be at least 2 days old.
They found one in the second wharf that they stopped at. The fishermen were just about to throw it
away.

It had a strong ammonia smell.
Stingrays double in ammonia almost every hour after dying.
Ammonia could bind to toxins and prevent Aajonus from dying of the poisonous injections.
Ammonia is also what they kidneys use to separate the blood plasma from red blood cells, which
produces urine.

He ate 3 to 4 ounces at a time, every 4 to 5 hours, and vomited most of it.
Enough of it got into his blood, and he stopped passing out.

He had managed to save himself.

Aajonus ate plenty of raw unsalted cheese and clay over the following days, to remove as many
toxins as possible.

He was nauseous for months, and aged overnight, looking much older and losing muscles, which
some attendees of his regular Q&As noticed and mentioned to him.
It took years from him to recover.

Aajonus published photos of his skin eruptions in his newsletter, where the cells burned from
mercury could be seen.

He also published photos of his iris, which now displayed new spots of toxicity and had many white
patterns, indicating massive cellular destruction in his body.

He also took a hair test which revealed high amounts of heavy metals.

Aajonus would later have further confirmation that what he had been injected with was a swine flu
vaccine.
From January to April 2013, his hands and mouth started smelling like pork, because of the pork
tissue they used to make the vaccine. Aajonus hadn’t eaten pork in 3 months.

Aajonus speculated they did not want to kill him then, but only to inject him with vaccines, so that
they could arrest him at the airport and show him being sick with swine flu, as he was one of the
most vocal opponents to swine flu vaccination.

When he came back to the USA, he talked in three more radio shows about the swine flu swindle,
refusing to be intimidated.

Aajonus wrote a 6-page document explaining how the ingredients of the swine flu vaccine are toxic
on their own and in synergy.

He put it on saynotoswineflu.net which he had asked his webmaster, Jim Ellingson, to make.


2010 — 64th year

Although he didn’t look like it, Aajonus was 18% body fat.
He looked closer to what people would describe as 8-10% body fat.

Raw fats are more compact and can expand from two to a hundred times its normal size from
cooking.
It took Aajonus years to replace his old fat throughout his body.
Toxicity also creates swelling and bloating.
When Aajonus was particularly sick, he would keep his body fat at 27-30%, like a woman’s. He had
three sizes worth of clothes.

In a 17 June 2010 interview, Aajonus told Mina Olen that the last fifteen years of evolution of his
Primal Diet led to it reversing 90% of disease. Some diseases were harder to heal, such as lung
cancer which averaged 50% on his diet.

Just like with the Elnora Van Winkle report for Aajonus’ patients, attempts to follow Aajonus’
patients long-term were made, but because of lack of funding, they were not followed through.

Aajonus noted that half of his cancer patients were long-time (12-35 years) vegetarians.

There were around 60 Medical Doctors who were on Aajonus’ diet, some of them would leave his
book in their waiting room for their patients to read.
Some doctors also stopped practising after learning of Aajonus’ diet, and reconverted into other
kinds of health practise, like sports therapy and rehabilitation.

Through his trust, Aajonus oversaw around 40 to 60 food clubs in the United States, 6 of which
were in Los Angeles. He didn’t give exact figures because of the government monitoring his
activities.

Aajonus stopped the government from shutting down 4 Amish farmers that year, such as Vernon
Hershberger of the Rainbow Acres farm in Wisconsin.

## Parent’s Death

Aajonus’ parents died in 2010 and 2011 in Dayton, Ohio.
Josef died on January 9, 2010, at Good Samaritan Hospital, at 93.
Doris died on February 23, 2011, at 91.

Josef was taking 63 medications a day, and Doris, around 20.

They had started declining in their 60s, and Aajonus had managed to get them eat raw foods.

For breakfast, they had eat raw eggs, raw fresh orange juice, honey, and raw cream for breakfast.

For lunch, they had a salad with raw olive oil and grated raw unsalted cheese.


They didn’t want to eat raw meat, even raw fish.
However, they cooked their meat less.

They ate raw milk, except when it was too difficult to get, and cheese with their cooked meal, and
had a small salad with vinegar to neutralize some of the over-acidity of cooked foods.

They were following the diet around 50% and were getting better.

In their mid-80s, they decided to stop eating raw foods, and eat as they did before, to not live too
long.

Aajonus didn’t understand their reasoning.
They were happy with the life they lived, and thought that if they kept eating raw foods, the
extension in their longevity would mean they would deteriorate over a longer period of time.
Aajonus didn’t agree with their theory, and told them they were actually going to be less ill over
time, and may just go to sleep peacefully one day without disease, but they wouldn’t want to take
the risk.

Josef had a stroke and was hospitalized the last 3 years of his life.
Aajonus visited him 3 times a year, and would bring him a raw milkshake every day. He would start
to heal and become able to sit up, even though he couldn’t control his left hand and leg.
Aajonus would ask someone else to bring him milkshakes, but he would refuse them. He only drank
them when Aajonus brought them.

Doris became frail in the last 6 years of her life, and was mentally stable until her last 6 months.

They had both grown up on raw milk, and raw milk was commonplace until pasteurization became
standardized in 1928.

## First Rawesome Raid

The 30th of June 2010, the authorities raided Aajonus’ biggest club, Rawesome.

Armed policemen drew their guns although there was no threat. In Aajonus’ words, as if the raw
milk was going to attack them.

The FBI, the FDA, the Los Angeles County Health Department, the California Department of
Agriculture, the Los Angeles City Attorney, and even agents of the Canadian government were part
of the raid.
4 out of the 6 organizations gave their cards. The Canadian agents were present because Aajonus
also had clubs in Canada, however they did not give their cards.

They gave Rawesome an incomplete warrant, withholding the full document.

The warrant claimed that they were allowed to take samples of foods, which should have been vials.
However, they took 17 large coolers of products, committing grand theft, according to Aajonus.


The coolers did not just contain raw milk, but many other foods like raw honey, which were not
even supposed to be an issue.

Aajonus was in Thailand, but was informed live on the phone, and giving people instructions.
As usual, he told them to cut down the seal and reopen as soon as the authorities would leave.

So the club reopened immediately after 6 hours of raiding.

The warrant was fraudulent, because warrants could only be issued for felonies, however it cited
only supposed permit violations, which is a misdemeanour.

The backlash for this raid was monumental and gave Aajonus and his movement worldwide
publicity. For example, Colbert talked about it on his late night show.

## The Sharon Palmer Food Scandal

An internal scandal erupted at Rawesome.

Aajonus accused one of the farmers, Sharon Palmer, of “Healthy Family Farm”, of selling low-
quality commercial chicken and eggs under false high-quality organic labels to Rawesome,
defrauding the members and causing some to be sick, including Aajonus, and a little girl.

She was in breach of the contract, which was saying the eggs had to be organic, not fed soy, and not
washed with anything more than a wet cloth with water at most.

Aajonus told James Stewart 40 times over 2 years about the issue, but he was dismissing it, telling
Aajonus he didn’t know what he was talking about, and promising him the food was good and up to
standards.
Often, James screamed at Aajonus at Rawesome in front of many members.

It was not the first time that James had done this. He had distributed cooked flax and sunflower oils
and sesame seeds as raw in Rawesome in the past.

Aajonus discovered that James owned part of Sharon’s farm, and was making $10,000 from it.
Sharon was also making $10,000 a month from it.

Sharon was not the legal owner of the farm, and had burned down the historical barn and built many
structures without permits.

After the Rawesome raid, Aajonus was fed up, and thought it was a good opportunity to shake
things up, so he hired a detective firm to gather the evidence of it, and obtained decisive proof.
Ex-employees were interviewed and provided photos. They had been fired because they complained
to Sharon that she was scamming 12 farmer markets and Rawesome.

They would buy frozen commercial chickens, thaw them, remove them from their packaging, and
put them in a new packaging.

One member had written to the district attorney, saying that his little girl had lead poisoning from
the school she was going to, and almost died.


They put her on a special diet to purge the lead from the body, and bought their foods from
Rawesome.
They were doing blood tests every month, and noticed she started getting extremely high levels of
mercury and arsenic.

With Aajonus, they checked everything she had been eating, which was exclusively from
Rawesome. When they tested Sharon’s eggs, they were high in mercury.

Aajonus had a similar experience. Every time he would be in LA and eat those eggs, the more he
ate, the more sick he got. He would get big sores all over his neck.
He didn’t know whether it was detoxification or food intoxication until the tests were done.

In spite of this, James still refused to stop buying from Sharon, so Aajonus had to attack him legally,
launching a civil lawsuit against him and Sharon Palmer.

However, that would end up destroying the club and weaken Aajonus’ support, up until and beyond
his death.

## The Betrayals

Aajonus put the evidence on a website [https://www.unhealthyfamilyfarm.com,](https://www.unhealthyfamilyfarm.com,) that was set up by Larry
Otting.

He emailed 1,500 of the 1,900 Rawesome members whose emails he had.
Only 22 members came to view the evidence.
Six of them were angry at Aajonus because they believed Stewart and Palmer, who had told them
that the 5 ex-employees who had worked for her and testified against her were "disgruntled
employees”.

Ebrahim Rafatjah, who had been Aajonus’ cameraman for years, was one of the people who got
fooled by James, at the time.

Another person was a woman Aajonus had helped heal from cancer.
She was distributing the low quality foods from James in a smaller circuit, and first told people she
didn’t believe Aajonus.
After having read the website, she still believed the arguments of James and Sharon.
Aajonus said that anyone who read the proof on his website and thought rationally could see he was
right about the fraudulent food.
He was disappointed with her, and wanted people to stop going through her.

## Government Persecution

Aajonus had plans to build a spa in South East Asia.
However, every time a potential Thai partner was offering to build it with him, they would go
bankrupt.

He had to start living clandestinely.
He couldn’t use his credit card or his cell phone anymore, to avoid being tracked.
He rigged his property with traps so that if someone intruded on him again, they would get killed.


Aajonus was often asked how his son Jeff was doing.
Although he ate some raw foods, he had suffered such damage and did not take care of himself as
much as Aajonus did, and looked more like a brother than a son to Aajonus.

2011 — 65th year

The Primal Diet had changed tens of thousands of people’s lives.

In the last 30 years, Aajonus had been consulted by around 1500 people for cancer, and around 95%
managed to reverse it.

In 2011, Aajonus was receiving emails from around 15 people daily, ever since his book came out,
and a total of around 100 emails a day.

Aajonus signed his emails with “Appreciatively and Healthfully”.

Aajonus’ tumor that developed over his stomach as the result of the surgery started at the size of a
fist, and was now down to the size of four beans.

Every year, it gradually dissolved. During the detoxification, Aajonus would feel strong pain from
it, as well as back pain in the center of where the radiation bolt was.

In March 2011, Aajonus vomited for 24 hours and analyzed the contents of the vomit. The
laboratory found AZT, the chemotherapy drug that was administered to Aajonus, and iodine that is
used in the radiation process. Aajonus was still detoxifying toxicity from 42 years earlier.

Aajonus was now sleeping only three to four hours per night, going to sleep at around 11pm.

Aajonus made a 2h14 recipe DVD where he shows how to prepare sauces, cheesecake, in a couple
minutes only, as well as vegetable juice, and coconut cream, using three machines, a blender, a food
processor, and a juicer.

## Gun Training

In June 2010, because of his forced abduction and injections, Aajonus was taking a 7-day gun
training course in Nevada for a concealed carry weapon permit.

Aajonus thought that the worsening abuse of the government could lead to a revolution, or a civil
war, seeing as himself, who had been a non-violent person his whole life, was now taking gun
training.


## Second Rawesome Raid

The Rawesome club was raided again the 3rd of August 2011, and $60,000 to $80,000 worth of food
were confiscated.

James Stewart, the co-founder, was arrested, even though he was the manager, and not the owner,
which Aajonus was.
He was charged for selling raw milk.

Sharon Palmer was also arrested for financial fraud.
She happened to be a two-time convicted felon that scammed millions of dollars out of elderly
people through reverse-mortgage schemes.

Victoria Bloch was also arrested, with less important charges.

Aajonus’ wasn’t present again.
If he had been, he would have made everybody lie on the ground, so that the authorities wouldn’t
have been able to move the truck away without taking all of them to jail. The more people would
have done it, the more it would have created a backlash in the media, and made the general public
aware of the government’s actions.

Aajonus assumed that the members would have known to react this way, however, since they didn’t,
Aajonus decided that he would write down instructions for when such scenarios would occur again
in the future, just like he trained his farmers.

Aajonus didn’t want to sue the government on his own, for strategic reasons.
He had seen evidence being manipulated when only one person was involved, so having more
people be involved was a way to monitor the proceedings.

The previous year, Aajonus wasn’t able to gather enough support to sue the government, because of
internal dissent over the Sharon Palmer issue.

According to him, the 2011 raid probably wouldn’t have happened if they had sued the government
after the 2010 raid.

Aajonus learned from this experience that when setting up a club, he needed more strict contracts.

That year, Aajonus started to remind people that he needed more support from him, during rallies,
hearings, and other events.
He had his own farm and wasn’t helping people because he needed to.

This is a speech he made during the interview that took place after the raid:
“What people need to do is just be there to support the people who are leading them, like me.
Whenever I give a call for Right to Choose Healthy Foods or for Rawesome or another club in
another state, we've got lots of clubs and lots of farmers. So whenever there's a hearing on the
matter, and I filed a lawsuit against the FDA because they filed a lawsuit against one of my farmers
in Philadelphia, so I filed a lawsuit across complaint and intervention. Now, when we go to court, I
need people there to support, to watch, to make sure that judge and that court and everybody in it
behaves constitutionally. And that takes eyes, and it takes people taking notes, recording it with a
camera, whatever it is, recording it with a voice, making sure that we have everything down. So if
there's errors made, purposely or not, we know what they are, and we can prove that they were


errors. So we need support, and of course, if we're looking for a legislature to get the legislative
body to change the law, we need to show up for a rally to do that. So if I put out an email that said
this particular event is happening, and we need people to show, we need people to be responsible to
show. If they don't show, they're going to lose. I'm fighting for everybody. I don't have to worry
about it. I have my own farm. I have my own food. I'm not doing this for me. So if you don't
support me, and you die on your own with your own food, your own sources, it's not my
responsibility. It's not my fault. I've done as much as I can do to help you, but you've got to show if
you want to help yourself and your other fellow members, and even the people you don't know, and
even the people in your own family, your mother or father. You want to give them the choice
sometime in their life if they don't have the choice to think healthfully now, at least dietarily. So we
need to make it available. We need to make the rights and the ability to have healthy food available
now.”
Aajonus, 9 August 2011

James Stewart was released on bail a couple days later.

Rawesome never reopened after this raid.

Aajonus questioned the theory of evolution.

He had seen laboratory experiments where flies instantly manifested on rocks, without any eggs
being present.

He did not necessarily believe in the Bible either, although he considered some of the stories about
people having lived into a very old age could have had some basis in reality.

2012 — 66th year

By that time, Aajonus claimed he could reverse 95% of diseases.

His Primal Diet had reached a near-final degree of completion for around 20 years.

Aajonus was featured on The Doctors TV show.

They cut out more than 90% of Aajonus’ answers from the episode.

In February 2012, Sharon Palmer filed a cross-complaint against Aajonus and Larry Otting,
accusing them of defamation and of harming her farm’s business.

The trial would take place the following year.

In July 2012, James Stewart server 4 months of jail time, after having accepted a plea bargain.


The press started attacking Aajonus over the Rawesome conflict, such as the Natural News website,
who posted several articles calling Aajonus a fraud, with a fake name, fake academic credentials,
and fake laboratory evidence against Sharon Palmer.

Mike Adams, of Natural News, also went on Info Wars to attack Aajonus.

Aajonus published an answer to him.

Regarding the food tests, it was highly likely, according to Ms. Tamara Hanson, the person who had
done the tests, that Sharon Palmer had submitting better-quality meat and chickens when Mike
Adams asked her one to do an independent test, but confirmed that for the weeks prior, the results
of the tests indicated high levels of mercury.

Larry Otting’s answer to Mike Adams was the following:
"I am exceedingly angry that he would focus on such inconsequential issues regarding my
involvement in this nasty little scam laid at my feet by Sharon and James. They have caused me to
be charged with two separate counts of ongoing criminal court cases. I want to tell my side of this
con job story but my attorney as advise me against it. The truth will come out in the trial and not the
press. I told Adams this in advance of his latest stories and yet he bates me with silly statements that
have little relevance to the true facts of this case.”

## Truck Sabotage

In July 2012, Aajonus was driving his pickup truck in Thailand.

At only 15mph, on a narrow road, the truck veered off, rolled upside-down, and started to sink
underwater.

Aajonus broke the windshield and managed to get out with his girlfriend.

This is in spite of the fact that his truck had a complete check-up in a Toyota dealership just a
couple days prior.

Aajonus then inspected his other vehicles and discovered they also got structural damage that could
only come from sabotage.

2013 — 67th year

In march 2013, Aajonus claimed his success rate with cancer was now of 99%, ever since he
introduced consistent hot baths in his protocols.
In the last 5 years, Aajonus only lost 4 out of 500 people.

Aajonus’ last Q&A and workshop took place the 22nd of June 2013.

In his last years of lecturing, he highlighted the importance of raw unsalted cheese as an extremely
potent agent for healing.


Aajonus had learned that almost everybody could repair at any age, but that the amount of vaccines
one person had was the main factor.
“How much mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, detergent, ether do you have stored in
combinations in your tissues? That is the big stopper.”

Even with an advanced raw food diet like the Primal Diet, it could take more than a lifetime to fully
clear out all vaccine toxicity.

However, raw unsalted cheese was able to remove toxins at a rate like no other food could, and
without side-effects.

Aajonus had a client who was one of the most sickly-looking people he had seen, skinny, with grey
skin, to whom he recommended to eat a piece of raw unsalted cheese every 15 minutes.
When he saw him again, he had cleared most of this mercury toxicity and was looking radiant.
Aajonus was surprised, and asked him what he had done.
He had eaten 10 times more cheese than Aajonus had recommended him, as much as he craved.

With protocols such as this one, and the hot baths, on the Primal Diet, it became possible to
accomplish detoxification, and therefore healing, 6 times faster.

## The Rawesome Sharon Palmer Trial

On July 8, 2013, the trial opposing Aajonus and Larry Otting, on one side, and Sharon Palmer, on
the other side, took place.

Aajonus had spent 4 weeks preparing for the trial, and $20,000 to ensure that important witnesses
from as far as Bali Indonesia were present to testify.

Judge Green decided it would be a no-jury trial, although the court calendar was stating it would be
a jury trial.

The last words said during the trial were from Aajonus:
"Your honor, I came here for your help to get justice but you have done nothing but undermined this
case from the beginning."

The result was a settlement, with no damages awarded.

Part of the settlement was an injunction prohibiting Aajonus from saying or writing anything
disparaging about Sharon Palmer.

Aajonus sent a newsletters a couple days letter, part of which is reproduced below:

« Is it probable that government agencies/agents used Sharon Palmer to divide us by patronizing
and trapping James Stewart? It certainly looks that way. However, evidence shows that James
Stewart made a decision at sometime to knowingly betray all of the members at Rawesome and lie
about the quality of food from Sharon and HFF.

The fact that Sharon spent very little time in prison for her felony convictions for her and her ex-
husband's stealing millions of dollars (estimates are about $13 millions; banks refuse to tell) from


elderly people, leaving them homeless in reverse-mortgages scams, and that she did not pay much
restitution, if any, is puzzling. Who made that happen? Are we going to attribute that to an over-
sympathetic judge who was wooed by Sharon's beauty and charm?

The charges for such crimes would have had most criminals serving at least 4 years for each count.
Did government agencies offer her a deal she could not refuse? Did governmental agents recruit her
to end Rawesome and help destroy the cohesive food-freedom movement in Los Angeles?

HER PLAN AND METHOD: Does Sharon Palmer's history and criminal record show she liked
quick-money-making endeavors or hard-working ones? She was an office woman. Why did Sharon
Palmer all of a sudden become an "organic" farmer but do nothing organic? Why is she being
protected from so many crimes by governments?

Consider that husbandry-farming is a profession that takes no less than 7 hard years to profit with
considerable financial investment, including thousands of acres of grazing land. Sharon and the
farm-dreamers only had 5 manageable acres. Was it reasonable that Sharon promised all investors
and James that she would have all investors paid with substantial interest within one year with a
profit from the farm?

Why in the world would she choose farming to make a bundle in one year, when no one has ever
made a meager profit from farming in less than 5 years? She told investors she could do it in one
year. Yes, she claimed she had a windfall sum coming her way but it did not come in one year and it
did not pay off all of her debts.

SHE COULD NOT HAVE MADE HER WAY INTO RAWESOME WITHOUT PROMISE OF
ORGANIC-QUALITY FOOD. There is not one thread of tangible evidence that proves she ever did
anything organic at the farm, not even with her goats? She never bought an organic animal. There is
no evidence trail, including paper to any organic origin. Those of you who visited and toured the
farm know that she claimed everything on her farm was organic. There is no way that she could
have made her way into Rawesome without her claiming organic.

Now, the 3some claim that Sharon never stated she was organic and never claimed to be organic.
Contrary to her claims, she gave and used RTCHF membership agreements at farmers' markets
identifying the beyond-organic quality of food. I personally can attest that they are lying and are
criminals who violated our trust and health.

We have eye-witness testimonies from 5 intelligent sources that all of the animals she bought from
2008 onward were not organic. Two eye-witnesses testified that one batch of hundreds of chicks
were so sickly that 1/3 died in the first week. There is plenty of evidence that Sharon bought and
sold commercial food weekly, that her patrons were farmers' market buyers and Right To Choose
Healthy Food members, and that she claimed it was all grown at her HFF beyond organically.

More evidence that would support the notion that Sharon could be with the governmental
conspiracy to divide us is that governments hold the forged deed that she made to raise funds to
gain the farm mainly from club-member investors. Why didn't the Los Angeles DA prosecute her
for that very serious felony violation? Because she is working with governmental agencies in this
arena?

Los Angeles City and County District attorneys gave Sharon and Victoria slaps-on-the-hand-
misdemeanor convictions for selling unlicensed food and let them go on almost 30 felony counts.
How is that possible?


Since Los Angeles County uses vast resources to convict misdemeanor shoplifters, why didn't it
charge Sharon for the felony forged deed? Are they protecting her? Sure tastes like it.

How did Sharon maker her way into James and Rawesome? Was James an easy mark for her
because James trusted many of the wrong people, had a big unrealistic heart, little backbone for
sacrifice, easily provoked, and lacked common sense when it came to Sharon's unrealistic farm
idea?

Why did Sharon get involved with Victoria Bloch? How is it that Sharon, having no interest in
organic and buying her food at regular commercial markets, ended up at a Weston A. Price
Foundation meeting that is about quality organic food and met Victoria? Could Sharon have marked
her because Victoria was affiliated with the a notable foundation that rallies for the clean-food
without soy or GMO-stuff movement and was an easy mark?

Wouldn't taking-down Victoria in a food scandal involving soy and GMO corn (the very products
that the foundation publicly criticizes regularly) be a great blow to the food-rights movement? But
Victoria would have to be a willing seller of soy and corn-based product. According to 2
independent witnesses, Victoria was and did.

How was Sharon able to so easily escape my lawsuit and trial by Judge Green violating proper
procedures? It seems that she would have to have some intricate connection with government.

However this played, are we going to let all of the confusion distract us from fighting for food-
freedom, our right to choose healthy food? »

Aajonus stated that James Stewart had harmed their food-movement immeasurably.

## Aajonus’ Death

One of the last people Aajonus saw confided that in his last year, Aajonus was different, more
worried, defeated, and told him he couldn’t clear the last attack on him.

Ebrahim, Aajonus' former cameraman, made a similar statement, saying that Aajonus looked scared
in court, and jumped when he saw him.

Ebrahim also said that 3 weeks before his death, they met again, and Aajonus hugged him, letting
go of the grudge he had against him over the Rawesome downfall.

Jim, Aajonus’ webmaster, had a dream where Aajonus was telling him goodbye.

Aajonus officially died the 28th of August 2013, at 66 years old, from a balcony fall in his remote
property, in Thailand property.

**The official story:**

This was told by an associate of Aajonus’ organization RTCHF.


« At the end of the week last week, Aajonus was with his girlfriend, in Thailand on a balcony on his
house. He was cleaning a wound to his hand, and went to the railing to throw the rest of the washing
fluid to the ground. She turned away to do something, and heard a crashing noise. The railing was
broken, at least in that spot, and she heard moaning. She rushed to the ground below, and found him
there.

He broke his back quite severely, next to the first rib, and could not move his legs. He took charge
of the care of his body, even in the hospital, where he had them wrap his torso to stabilize the bones.
He did have one x-ray, and then would not let them do more. The doctors wanted to operate, and he
refused. He had them wrap him and feed him his food, and continued so for two days. He was
apparently in good spirits, but did experience what must have been severe pain, for he did let them
give him at least two pain shots. This might have been necessary for him to stay awake and in
control, as the body can shut down from pain. There was blood in his stomach at some point, for he
did regurgitate some food with blood in it.

On the third day of his hospital stay, he sent his girlfriend to a court proceeding in Bangkok, about
3.5 hrs away, about the land there in Thailand, over her protests. He insisted she go. While she was
gone, he went into a coma, and they put an IV in him. When she returned he was very bad. At this
point she emailed our Thai member, who called a few of us. The doctors say he had a kidney
infection and blood infection. They continued to feed him butter and honey, as instructed, and
followed his wishes as possible. They gave him oxygen as his breathing decreased, and he steadily
lost blood pressure. They told us his kidneys had stopped functioning, were not producing urine.
They wanted to do something, but no one had any authority to override his stated wishes. When his
heart failed, they pumped his heart and tried to resuscitate him for a half hour. Our Thai member
was on the phone with Aajonus’ girlfriend and could hear the flatline beep of the heart monitor. ...
They stopped resuscitation efforts at 2 am August 28th Thai time, Noon on August 27th Los
Angeles time.

The way I read it, Vonderplanitz may have been afraid to have rural doctors operate on him, and
likely died from the effects of internal bleeding. »

Many have questioned this narrative.

Photos of Aajonus’ body were never shown.

The autopsies were also hidden, and listed 5 causes of death from 11 different doctors, as revealed
by his son Jeff in his interview from June 9, 2022.

Many, including Jeff, believe Aajonus was assassinated.

Some claimed seeing him after his supposed death.
Could Aajonus have staged his death?

**The assassination theory:**

Aajonus claimed several assassination attempts on his life: poison being put in his food, his truck
getting sabotaged, receiving forced injections while asleep in a hotel.


He opposed health authorities, the medical industry, the food industry, the state.

The balcony could have been sabotaged by Aajonus’ enemies.
He could have also been killed off once in the hospital.

**The staged death theory:**

Not too long after Aajonus' death, health blogger David Gumpert, who knew him, wrote an article
about the possibility of Aajonus having staged his death, citing testimonies of sightings from ex-
associates.

"Some months after California nutritionist and food rights advocate Aajonus Vonderplanitz died
three years ago in Thailand, I was hearing reports from a couple of his former associates that he
had been sighted in the Los Angeles area."
"The individual they saw had had plastic surgery to alter his appearance, they said, but they were
sure from his gait and general appearance that it was him. When they went to get closer to him, he
rushed off, and disappeared into the urban landscape, they said."

Aajonus letting go of his grudge with Ebrahim 3 weeks before disappearing could also be an
indication that Aajonus had planned his exit.

On October 12th, 2018, 5 years after Aajonus' death, Paul Kruhm, who had inherited Aajonus’
trusts, published a video “Aajonus What Actually Happened”, to "put these matters to rest",
countering the assassination and death staging theories, which were circulating on the main Primal
Diet Facebook group.

In this video, Paul, Wasma, and Lucky discuss the matter.
They support the theory that Aajonus’ death was accidental.

Some people believe that this is a cover-up, citing the participants’ behavioural cues like repeated
nervous laughter.

Paul said the following:
“Aajonus couldn't keep silent if you paid him a million dollars and gave it to him every week. He
would be loud and he would be somewhere in the US Capitol right now screaming, yelling, and
wanting everyone to throw him out. So it just makes zero sense that he just had enough of all of us
and thought he'd hide someplace. It just makes no sense at all.”

Right after Aajonus’ death, negative articles were written about him such as:

- In Death As In Life, Controversy Follows Aajonus Vonderplanitz (1 day after his death)
- The Dark Side of the Aajonus Vonderplanitz Legacy (3 days after his death)

The first of those articles quotes James Stewart – Aajonus’ ex-associate turned enemy during the
Rawesome debacle – saying that Aajonus “had pushed the karmic envelope”, and “if he gets
reincarnated, he’ll come back and do a better job”.

Some of Aajonus’ works were never published, such as his unfinished detoxification and food
books, as well as his nutritional classes, laboratory experiments, and more.
